	abstract = {A 3D porous composite consisting of nano-0D MoS2, nano-1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and nano-2D graphene is successful prepared using an electrostatic spray deposition (ESD) technique. Depending on the preparation procedure either nanodots of amorphous MoS2 (0.5–5 nm) or nanocrystalline few-layered MoS2 (5–10 nm) bonded to graphene-carbon nanotubes backbone are obtained. These functionalized carbon nanotubes adhere to a porous graphene-based network. Such composites can be directly ­deposited on the current collectors without any binder or conductive additives to assemble a battery that shows superior rate performance and cycling ­stability. For nanodots, nucleation and diffusion issues usually connected with ­conversion are largely mitigated if not totally nullified. The use of mechanically and diffusionally isolated but electrochemically well connected electroactive nanodots offer an effective solution to render conversion reaction reversible. The use of nano-1D and nano-2D carbon structures offer additional electrical and mechanical advantages that are discussed. Furthermore, this technique, which is easily extendable to other electrode materials, seems to be of a great potential, especially for thin-film batteries, flexible batteries, and future ­paintable batteries.},

The tin exists in the alloys as a second phase, typically as ∼1 μm inclusions (precipitates) distributed throughout the aluminium structure, and anodic dissolution occurs to form pits around the tin inclusions. Although the distribution of the gallium in the alloy could not be established, it is also shown to be critical in the formation of these pits as well as maintaining their activity. The stability of the alloys to open circuit corrosion and the overpotential for high rate dissolution, both critical to battery performance, are shown to depend on factors in addition to elemental composition; both heat treatment and mechanical working influence the performance of the alloy.

Mono- or few-layered TMDs — obtained either through exfoliation of bulk materials or bottom-up syntheses — are direct-gap semiconductors whose bandgap energy, as well as carrier type (n- or p-type), varies between compounds depending on their composition, structure and dimensionality. In this Review, we describe how the tunable electronic structure of TMDs makes them attractive for a variety of applications. They have been investigated as chemically active electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution and hydrosulfurization, as well as electrically active materials in opto-electronics. Their morphologies and properties are also useful for energy storage applications such as electrodes for Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors.},

MXenes are produced by selective etching of the A element from the MAX phases, which are metallically conductive, layered solids connected by strong metallic, ionic, and covalent bonds, such as Ti2AlC, Ti3AlC2, and Ta4AlC3. MXenes ­combine the metallic conductivity of transition metal carbides with the hydrophilic nature of their hydroxyl or oxygen terminated surfaces. In essence, they behave as “conductive clays”. This article reviews progress—both ­experimental and theoretical—on their synthesis, structure, properties, intercalation, delamination, and potential applications. MXenes are expected to be good candidates for a host of applications. They have already shown promising performance in electrochemical energy storage systems. A detailed outlook for future research on MXenes is also presented.},

	abstract = {A critical overview of the latest developments in the aluminum battery technologies is reported. The substitution of lithium with alternative metal anodes characterized by lower cost and higher abundance is nowadays one of the most widely explored paths to reduce the cost of electrochemical storage systems and enable long-term sustainability. Aluminum based secondary batteries could be a viable alternative to the present Li-ion technology because of their high volumetric capacity (8040 mAh cm−3 for Al vs 2046 mAh cm−3 for Li). Additionally, the low cost aluminum makes these batteries appealing for large-scale electrical energy storage. Here, we describe the evolution of the various aluminum systems, starting from those based on aqueous electrolytes to, in more details, those based on non-aqueous electrolytes. Particular attention has been dedicated to the latest development of electrolytic media characterized by low reactivity towards other cell components. The attention is then focused on electrode materials enabling the reversible aluminum intercalation-deintercalation process. Finally, we touch on the topic of high-capacity aluminum-sulfur batteries, attempting to forecast their chances to reach the status of practical energy storage systems.},

	abstract = {Identifying a suitable electrode material with desirable electrochemical properties remains a primary challenge for rechargeable Al-ion batteries. Recently an ultrafast rechargeable Al-ion battery was reported with high charge/discharge rate, (relatively) high discharge voltage and high capacity that uses a graphite-based cathode. Using calculations from first-principles, we have investigated the staging mechanism of AlCl4 intercalation into bulk graphite and evaluated the stability, specific capacity and voltage profile of AlCl4 intercalated compounds. Ab initio molecular dynamics is performed to investigate the thermal stability of AlCl4 intercalated graphite structures. Our voltage profiles show that the first AlCl4 intercalation step could be a more sluggish step than the successive intercalation steps. However, the diffusion of AlCl4 is very fast in the expanded graphite host layers with a diffusion barrier of ∼0.01 eV, which justifies the ultrafast charging rate of a graphite based Al-ion battery. And such an AlCl4 intercalated battery provides an average voltage of 2.01–2.3 V with a maximum specific capacity of 69.62 mA h g−1, which is excellent for anion intercalated batteries. Our density of states and Bader charge analysis shows that the AlCl4 intercalation into the bulk graphite is a charging process. Hence, we believe that our present study will be helpful in understanding the staging mechanism of AlCl4 intercalation into graphite-like layered electrodes for Al-ion batteries, thus encouraging further experimental work.},

MCMB graphite and Co3O4 were used as probe active materials, since they exhibit different reaction mechanisms with lithium. Three different mixing procedures were used, (i) magnetic stirring, (ii) magnetic stirring with additional sonication steps and (iii) ball milling. SEM studies allow to determine that the mixing procedure has a significant effect in the microstructure of the active material. Indeed, ball milling was found to destroy the pristine MCMB microstructure and to induce agglomeration in nanosized Co3O4. While magnetic stirring is much less aggressive to that respect, sonication steps were found to enhance the homogeneity of the mixture without inducing major modifications in the microstructure of the materials and hence to have a beneficial impact in the final electrochemical performance.},

A map for pseudocapacitor electrodes is provided, depending on the demands of high conductivity and a remarkable peak of density of states (DOS) in the range of the electrolyte window. The calculated DOS suggests that most of the T phase structures are superior to H phase in electroconductibility. The charge storage capability is represented by the number of gaining or losing electrons calculated by integrating DOS in the electrolyte window. MS2 (M = Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Nb, Mo, Tc) of the T phase is conductive and gains electrons easily with considerable valence state change of the TM atom, showing a redox pseudocapacitance character as a cathode. Meanwhile, CoS2–H and MoSe2–T are promising anode materials. Moreover, the chalcogen (S, Se, Te) with different electronegativity and work function will result in the changes of Fermi level and surface polarization of MoX2, leading to the shift of their DOS in the electrolyte window. In another way, the metallic hydrogenated H phase of MoS2 (MoS2H2) with conductivity should have enhanced advanced electrochemical performance.},

This paper provides an overview of recently developed materials for aluminum–air batteries to be used in various elements, including the anode, air cathode and electrolyte. Aluminum can be alloyed with other active metal elements such as Tin (Sn), Indium (In), Gallium (Ga) and Zinc (Zn). Its binary and tertiary alloys demonstrate improved battery performance. Bifunctional air cathodes fabricated using oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, CoO/N-CNT with oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, Ni–Fe-layered double hydroxide/CNT and MnO2/N-CNT yield excellent results. With regard to electrolytes, several types have been considered: aqueous, non-aqueous, aprotic solvent and solid-state electrolytes. The addition of corrosion inhibitors to an aqueous electrolyte helps to enhance battery performance, whereas non-aqueous and aprotic solvent electrolytes can be used to prevent hydrogen evolution. Polymer electrolytes can overcome the battery leakage problem. As a conclusion, the future research trends related to this type of battery have also been indicated.},

As a result of immense progress in the field, cost-effective and high performance batteries are imperative to meeting the future demand of sustainability. Currently, the best performing batteries are lithium-ion based, but limited lithium (Li) resources make research into alternatives essential. In recent years, the performance of aluminium-ion batteries has improved remarkably in all battery-relevant metrics, which renders them a promising alternative. Compared with monovalent Li-ion batteries, aluminium (Al) cations can carry three positive charges, which could result in higher energy densities. This review describes recent developments in Al-based cathode materials. The major goal of this review is to highlight strengths and weaknesses of various different approaches and provide guidelines for future research.},

The cell has a capacity of 60 mAh g-1 at 6 C, over 6,000 cycles with Coulombic efficiency ∼ 99\%. Raman spectroscopy shows two different intercalation processes involving chloroaluminate anions at the two discharging plateaus, while C-Cl bonding on the surface, or edges of natural graphite, is found using X-ray absorption spectroscopy.

At this relatively high sulfur loading, we evaluated the impact of binder and carbon type on the mechanical integrity and the electrochemical properties of sulfur electrodes. We identified hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) as a new binder for the sulfur electrode because it offers better adhesion between the electrode and the aluminum current collector than the commonly used polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder. In combination with the binder study, multiple types of carbon with high specific surface area were evaluated as sulfur hosts for high loading sulfur electrodes. A commercial microporous carbon derived from wood with high pore volume showed the best performance. An electrode with sulfur loading up to 10 mg cm−2 was achieved with the optimized recipe. Based on systematic electrochemical studies, the soluble polysulfide to insoluble Li2S2/Li2S conversion was identified to be the major barrier for high loading sulfur electrodes to achieve high sulfur utilization.},

Anatase titanium dioxide has been suggested as a potential anode material for aqueous Al-ion batteries. In this work, TiO2 nanospheres (TiO2-NSs) with highly mesoporous morphology and large specific surface area (179.9 m2 g− 1) were synthesized via hydrolysis of titanium glycolate precursor and subsequent hydrothermal treatment and calcination in an argon atmosphere. The structure and morphology of the prepared TiO2-NSs were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and nitrogen adsorption-desorption. The high surface area TiO2-NSs provide large electrode/electrolyte interface and good electrolyte-holding characteristic, leading to shorten the diffusion path of electrons and ions to the active material, which results in the better high-rate performance. The TiO2-NSs anode exhibited a high initial discharge capacity of 183 mAh g− 1 at a current rate of 0.15 C and a superior rate performance with a capacity of 108 mAh g− 1 even at a discharge current rate of 6.0 C, which are much higher than those of TiO2-P25 electrode.},

Metal sulfides with unique physical and chemical properties, as well as high specific capacity/capacitance, which are typically multiple times higher than that of the carbon/graphite-based materials, are currently studied as promising electrode materials. However, the implementation of these sulfide electrodes in practical applications is hindered by their inferior rate performance and cycling stability. Nanostructures offering the advantages of high surface-to-volume ratios, favourable transport properties, and high freedom for the volume change upon ion insertion/extraction and other reactions, present an opportunity to build next-generation LIBs and SCs. Thus, the development of novel concepts in material research to achieve new nanostructures paves the way for improved electrochemical performance. Herein, we summarize recent advances in nanostructured metal sulfides, such as iron sulfides, copper sulfides, cobalt sulfides, nickel sulfides, manganese sulfides, molybdenum sulfides, tin sulfides, with zero-, one-, two-, and three-dimensional morphologies for LIB and SC applications. In addition, the recently emerged concept of incorporating conductive matrices, especially graphene, with metal sulfide nanomaterials will also be highlighted.

MX2 heterostructures are particularly exciting for novel optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications, because two-dimensional MX2 monolayers can have an optical bandgap in the near-infrared to visible spectral range and exhibit extremely strong light–matter interactions. Theory predicts that many stacked MX2 heterostructures form type II semiconductor heterojunctions that facilitate efficient electron–hole separation for light detection and harvesting. Here, we report the first experimental observation of ultrafast charge transfer in photoexcited MoS2/WS2 heterostructures using both photoluminescence mapping and femtosecond pump–probe spectroscopy. We show that hole transfer from the MoS2 layer to the WS2 layer takes place within 50 fs after optical excitation, a remarkable rate for van der Waals coupled two-dimensional layers. Such ultrafast charge transfer in van der Waals heterostructures can enable novel two-dimensional devices for optoelectronics and light harvesting.},

	abstract = {High quality and stable electrical contact between metal and two-dimensional materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, is a necessary requirement that has yet to be achieved in order to successfully exploit the advantages that these materials offer to electronics and optoelectronics. MoTe 2 , owing to its phase changing property, can potentially offer a solution. A recent study demonstrated that metallic phase of MoTe 2 connects its semiconducting phase with very low resistance. To utilize this property to connect other two-dimensional materials, it is important to achieve efficient charge transfer between MoTe 2 and other semiconducting materials. Using MoS 2 as an example, we report ultrafast and efficient charge transfer between MoTe 2 and MoS 2 monolayers. In the transient absorption measurements, an ultrashort pump pulse is used to selectively excite electrons in MoTe 2 . The appearance of the excited electrons in the conduction band of MoS 2 is monitored by using a probe pulse that is tuned to the resonance of MoS 2 . We found that electrons transfer to MoS 2 on a time scale of at most 0.3 ps. The transferred electrons give rise to a large transient absorption signal at both A-exciton and B-exciton resonances due to the screening effect. We also observed ultrafast transfer of holes from MoS 2 to MoTe 2 . Our results suggest the feasibility of using MoTe 2 as a bridge material to connect MoS 2 and other transition metal dichalcogenides, and demonstrate a new transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructure involving MoTe 2 , which extends the spectral range of such structures to infrared.},

	abstract = {As an emerging class of new materials, two-dimensional (2D) non-graphene materials, including layered and non-layered, and their heterostructures are currently attracting increasing interest due to their promising applications in electronics, optoelectronics and clean energy. In contrast to traditional semiconductors, such as Si, Ge and III–V group materials, 2D materials show significant merits of ultrathin thickness, very high surface-to-volume ratio, and high compatibility with flexible devices. Owing to these unique properties, while scaling down to ultrathin thickness, devices based on these materials as well as artificially synthetic heterostructures exhibit novel and surprising functions and performances. In this review, we aim to provide a summary on the state-of-the-art research activities on 2D non-graphene materials. The scope of the review will cover the preparation of layered and non-layered 2D materials, construction of 2D vertical van der Waals and lateral ultrathin heterostructures, and especially focus on the applications in electronics, optoelectronics and clean energy.

	abstract = {MXenes represent a large family of functionalized two-dimensional (2D) transition-metal carbides and carbonitrides. However, most of the understanding on their unique structures and applications stops at the theoretical suggestion and lack of experimental support. Herein, the surface structure and intercalation chemistry of Ti3C2X are clarified at the atomic scale by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The STEM studies show that the functional groups (e.g., OH–, F–, O–) and the intercalated sodium (Na) ions prefer to stay on the top sites of the centro-Ti atoms and the C atoms of the Ti3C2 monolayer, respectively. Double Na-atomic layers are found within the Ti3C2X interlayer upon extensive Na intercalation via two-phase transition and solid-solution reactions. In addition, aluminum (Al)-ion intercalation leads to horizontal sliding of the Ti3C2X monolayer. On the basis of these observations, the previous monolayer surface model of Ti3C2X is modified. DFT calculations using the new modeling help to understand more about their physical and chemical properties. These findings enrich the understanding of the MXenes and shed light on future material design and applications. Moreover, the Ti3C2X exhibits prominent rate performance and long-term cycling stability as an anode material for Na-ion batteries.},

Cooperation among the different components plays a subtle and important role in determining the physical and electrochemical properties of the electrode. In this study, the physical and electrochemical properties of a LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 cathode were investigated as a function of the electrode compositions. The electrode conductivity, porosity, specific capacity, first Coulombic efficiency, and rate capability were found significantly affected by the polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)-to-acetylene black (AB) ratio and the total inactive material amount. The electronic conductivity of the laminate does not so much decide the rate performance of the electrode as it is generally believed. The rate capability of the electrode is enhanced by an increase in the total inactive material content at a PVDF/AB ratio of 5:4, whereas it is deteriorated by increasing the total inactive material content at PVDF/AB ratios of 5:1 and 5:2. At a PVDF/AB ratio of 5:3, the rate performance is not considerably affected by the inactive material content. The result is explained by the competition between the ion-blocking effect of PVDF binder and the electronic conducting effect of the AB additive. A long-term cycling experiment shows the mechanical integrity of the laminate is important for the durability of the composite electrode.},

The experimental results reveal that the impact of charging currents and charging voltages on cycle life can vary markedly among different lithium-ion batteries. In general, the cycle life is influenced more by high charging currents than by high discharging currents. Different boost charging protocols have disclosed that high charging currents can deteriorate cycle life not only at high state of charge (SoC), but also at very low SoC. Our investigations on pulse charging show that lithium-ion cells withstand charging pulses of high current or high voltage without any deterioration in cycle life, when the duration of the pulses remains short and the mean current and voltage values are considerably lower. For pulses of less than 1 s, cycle life has been similar for pulsed and continuous charging with the same mean charging currents and identical cycle depths.
This paper also presents the impact of charging currents and charging voltages on capacity utilization, charging time, and efficiency to support the development process of optimized charging protocols for practical applications.},

	abstract = {Fast ion transport is essential for high rate capability in rechargeable battery operation. Recently, an ultrafast rechargeable aluminum-ion battery was experimentally demonstrated through the reversible intercalation/deintercalation of chloroaluminate anions (AlCl4–) in graphitic-foam cathodes. Using first-principles calculations, herein, we report that the unique structural characteristic of graphitic foam, i.e., mechanical flexibility of few-layered graphene nanomaterials, plays a key role for the ultrafast aluminum-ion battery. We found that AlCl4– is stored by forming doubly stacked ionic layers in the interlayer space between graphene sheets, and their diffusivity increases dramatically once graphene film is less than five layers thick; the diffusivity begins to increase when the film thickness reduces below five layers in such a way that the film thickness of four, three, and two graphene layers enables 48, 153, and 225 times enhanced diffusivity than that of the bulk graphite, respectively, and this nanoscale thickness is mainly responsible for the observed ultrafast rate capability of graphitic foam. The faster anion conductivity with the reduced film thickness is attributed to high elasticity of few-layered graphene, providing more space for facile AlCl4– diffusion. This study indicates that even bulky polyanions can be adopted as carrier ions for ultrahigh rate operation if highly elastic few-layered graphene is used as an active material.},

The stage and atomic structure of the graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) are elucidated, in line with the experimental finding. It is revealed that the intercalants tend to be inserted at relative high densities with a charging potential profile and theoretical specific capacity that agree well with the experiment. Four stable GIC configurations are identified with essentially the same chemical potential for the intercalant, giving rise to charging potential plateaus. Low diffusion energy barriers of the intercalants are found, which underlie the ultrafast (dis)charging rates of the battery.},

An obvious discharge voltage plateau appeared at 0.6 V in the discharge curves of the Ni–V2O5 cathode, which is slightly higher than that of the V2O5 nanowire cathodes with common binders. This improvement is attributed to reduced electrochemical polarization.},

	abstract = {As a promising post-lithium battery, rechargeable aluminum battery has the potential to achieve a three-electron reaction with fully use of metal aluminum. Alternative electrolytes are strongly needed for further development of rechargeable aluminum batteries, because typical AlCl3-contained imidazole-based ionic liquids are moisture sensitive, corrosive, and with low oxidation voltage. In this letter, a kind of noncorrosive and water-stable ionic liquid obtained by mixing 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([BMIM]OTF) with the corresponding aluminum salt (Al(OTF)3) is studied. This ionic liquid electrolyte has a high oxidation voltage (3.25 V vs Al3+/Al) and high ionic conductivity, and a good electrochemical performance is also achieved. A new strategy, which first used corrosive AlCl3-based electrolyte to construct a suitable passageway on the Al anode for Al3+, and then use noncorrosive Al(OTF)3-based electrolyte to get stable Al/electrolyte interface, is put forward.},

Because of this, onion-like carbon can be fabricated into electrodes, used as a conductive additive, and may have potential in composites and additive manufacturing. However due to agglomeration of OLC particles, creating a stable, aqueous dispersion for ink production or formulating composites proves challenging. We explore how attrition milling, acid treatment, and probe sonication can be employed to decrease agglomeration and provide colloidal stability in aqueous media. We also investigate how the electrochemical performance changes with each processing step as well as the treatments in succession. When tested in electrochemical capacitors, the processing increases the capacitance by a factor of three, due to an added pseudocapacitive contribution which is not present in untreated OLC. As a result, the processing of OLC proves to be advantageous for the production of stable, aqueous solutions, which also exhibit improved electrochemical properties suitable for functional inks, conductive additives, and fabrication of composite electrodes.},

	abstract = {Securing our energy future is the most important problem that humanity faces in this century. Burning fossil fuels is not sustainable, and wide use of renewable energy sources will require a drastically increased ability to store electrical energy. In the move toward an electrical economy, chemical (batteries) and capacitive energy storage (electrochemical capacitors or supercapacitors) devices are expected to play an important role. This Account summarizes research in the field of electrochemical capacitors conducted over the past decade.Overall, the combination of the right electrode materials with a proper electrolyte can successfully increase both the energy stored by the device and its power, but no perfect active material exists and no electrolyte suits every material and every performance goal. However, today, many materials are available, including porous activated, carbide-derived, and templated carbons with high surface areas and porosities that range from subnanometer to just a few nanometers. If the pore size is matched with the electrolyte ion size, those materials can provide high energy density. Exohedral nanoparticles, such as carbon nanotubes and onion-like carbon, can provide high power due to fast ion sorption/desorption on their outer surfaces. Because of its higher charge–discharge rates compared with activated carbons, graphene has attracted increasing attention, but graphene had not yet shown a higher volumetric capacitance than porous carbons.Although aqueous electrolytes, such as sodium sulfate, are the safest and least expensive, they have a limited voltage window. Organic electrolytes, such as solutions of [N(C2H5)4]BF4 in acetonitrile or propylene carbonate, are the most common in commercial devices. Researchers are increasingly interested in nonflammable ionic liquids. These liquids have low vapor pressures, which allow them to be used safely over a temperature range from −50 °C to at least 100 °C and over a larger voltage window, which results in a higher energy density than other electrolytes.In situ characterization techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) have improved our understanding of the electrical double layer in confinement and desolvation of ions in narrow pores. Atomisitic and continuum modeling have verified and guided these experimental studies. The further development of materials and better understanding of charged solid-electrolyte interfaces should lead to wider use of capacitive energy storage at scales ranging from microelectronics to transportation and the electrical grid. Even with the many exciting results obtained using newer materials, such as graphene and nanotubes, the promising properties reported for new electrode materials do not directly extrapolate to improved device performance. Although thin films of nanoparticles may show a very high gravimetric power density and discharge rate, those characteristics will not scale up linearly with the thickness of the electrode.},

For example, the realization of multivalent (MV) batteries, which offer a realistic route to superseding the electrochemical performance of Li-ion batteries, hinges on the discovery of host materials that possess adequate mobility of the MV intercalant to support reasonable charge and discharge times. This has proven especially challenging, motivating the current investigation of ion mobility (Li+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, and Al3+) in spinel Mn2O4, olivine FePO4, layered NiO2, and orthorhombic δ-V2O5. In this study, we not only quantitatively assess these structures as candidate cathode materials, but also isolate the chemical and structural descriptors that govern MV diffusion. Our finding that matching the intercalant site preference to the diffusion path topology of the host structure controls mobility more than any other factor leads to practical and implementable guidelines to find fast-diffusing MV ion conductors.},

	abstract = {The research on electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLC), also known as supercapacitors or ultracapacitors, is quickly expanding because their power delivery performance fills the gap between dielectric capacitors and traditional batteries. However, many fundamental questions, such as the relations between the pore size of carbon electrodes, ion size of the electrolyte, and the capacitance have not yet been fully answered. We show that the pore size leading to the maximum double-layer capacitance of a TiC-derived carbon electrode in a solvent-free ethyl-methylimmidazolium-bis(trifluoro-methane-sulfonyl)imide (EMI-TFSI) ionic liquid is roughly equal to the ion size (∼0.7 nm). The capacitance values of TiC−CDC produced at 500 °C are more than 160 F/g and 85 F/cm3 at 60 °C, while standard activated carbons with larger pores and a broader pore size distribution present capacitance values lower than 100 F/g and 50 F/cm3 in ionic liquids. A significant drop in capacitance has been observed in pores that were larger or smaller than the ion size by just an angstrom, suggesting that the pore size must be tuned with sub-angstrom accuracy when selecting a carbon/ion couple. This work suggests a general approach to EDLC design leading to the maximum energy density, which has been now proved for both solvated organic salts and solvent-free liquid electrolytes.},

The deposition of aluminum was found to proceed via a nucleation/growth mechanism, and the nucleation process was found to be progressive. The morphology of aluminum deposits was examined with photomicroscopy. It was shown that depending on the current densities (c.d.) applied, three types of aluminum deposits could be obtained, namely, spongy deposits formed at lower c.d. (below 0.7 mA/cm2), smooth layers deposited at intermediate c.d. (between 2 and 10 mA/cm2), and dendritic or porous deposits obtained at high c.d. (above 15 mA/cm2). However, the smooth aluminum deposits were about five times more voluminous than the theoretical value. The spongy deposits were formed due to difficulties in electronucleation and could be inhibited by application of pulsed currents and/or addition of manganese chloride into the melt.},

	abstract = {High surface area porous carbon frameworks exhibit potential advantages over crystalline graphite as an electrochemical energy storage material owing to the possibility of faster ion transport and up to double the ion capacity, assuming a surface-based mechanism of storage. When detrimental surface-related effects such as irreversible capacity loss due to interphase formation (known as solid-electrolyte interphase, SEI) can be mitigated or altogether avoided, the greatest advantage can be achieved by maximizing the gravimetric and volumetric surface area and by tailoring the porosity to accommodate the relevant ion species. We investigate this concept by employing zeolite-templated carbon (ZTC) as the cathode in an aluminum battery based on a chloroaluminate ionic liquid electrolyte. Its ultrahigh surface area and dense, conductive network of homogeneous channels (12 Å in width) render ZTC suitable for the fast, dense storage of AlCl4– ions (6 Å in ionic diameter). With aluminum as the anode, full cells were prepared which simultaneously exhibited both high specific energy (up to 64 Wh kg–1, 30 Wh L–1) and specific power (up to 290 W kg–1, 93 W L–1), highly stable cycling performance, and complete reversibility within the potential range of 0.01–2.20 V.},

The arc-discharge method provides an alternate pathway toward large scale synthesis. Due to its structure and electrochemical properties, carbon onions can be used as materials for electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLC) and can be used to store energy across a much wider temperature range, which gives these materials advantages over conventional EDLCs.

The resultant material demonstrates one of the highest capacities of 392 mAh g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and good cycling stability. It is revealed that the layered SnS2 nanosheets anchored on 3D reduced graphene oxide network endows the composite not only high electronic conductivity but also fast kinetic diffusion pathway. As a result, the hybrid material exhibits high rate performance (112 mAh g−1 at 1000 mA g−1). The detailed characterization also verifies the intercalation and deintercalation of relatively large chloroaluminate anions into the layered SnS2 during the charge–discharge process, which is important for better understanding of the electrochemical process of AIBs.},

A rechargeable battery based on aluminium chemistry is envisioned to be a low cost energy storage platform, considering that aluminium is the most abundant metal in the Earth's crust. The high volumetric capacity of aluminium, which is four and seven times larger than that of lithium and sodium respectively, unarguably has the potential to boost the energy density of aluminium-batteries on a per unit volume basis. Efforts to develop rechargeable aluminium-batteries can be traced to as early as the 1970s, however this area of research has seen a surge in activity since 2010, when the possibility of achieving an ambient temperature aluminium system was convincingly demonstrated. In recent times, rechargeable aluminium-batteries have been rechristened as aluminium-ion batteries. This review aims to comprehensively illustrate the developments regarding rechargeable non-aqueous aluminium-batteries or aluminium-ion batteries.

However, it is unknown whether Al3+ can be reversibly stored in the lattice of the host electrode material because of its small cation diameter and high valence state, thus trapping it tightly in lattice or defect sites. Here, we report the reversible storage of Al3+ in V2O5 nanowires. It is found that Al3+ intercalates into crystalized V2O5 nanowires in the first discharge. Meanwhile, this electrochemical intercalation leads to the reduction of V5+ and the formation of an amorphous layer on the edge of nanowires. In the subsequent cycling, a new phase forms along the nanowires’ edges and a two-phase transition reaction occurs. Our findings demonstrate clearly for the first time that it is possible that Al3+ can be inserted into the metal oxide and stored reversibly through intercalation and a phase-transition reaction, which is expected to inspire more comprehensive investigations for rechargeable aluminum batteries.},

The intercalation rate and hence, the current, appears to be controlled by the rate of Li+ diffusion within the TiS2. A model has been developed which predicts the current-time behavior under the control of Li+ solid state diffusion. The close agreement of this model with the experimental data allows the solid state diffusion coefficient and other transport parameters (such as effective electrode area) to be evaluated from the measured average grain boundary distance. Typical TiS2 grain boundary distances in the 3–10 μm range yield a geometric mean value of 1.3 × 10−9 cm2/s for the solid state diffusion coefficient; this is in close agreement with previously reported diffusivities as measured by NMR spin-lattice relaxation techniques.},

	abstract = {The challenges for further development of Li rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles are reviewed. Most important is safety, which requires development of a nonflammable electrolyte with either a larger window between its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) or a constituent (or additive) that can develop rapidly a solid/electrolyte-interface (SEI) layer to prevent plating of Li on a carbon anode during a fast charge of the battery. A high Li+-ion conductivity (σLi {\textgreater} 10−4 S/cm) in the electrolyte and across the electrode/electrolyte interface is needed for a power battery. Important also is an increase in the density of the stored energy, which is the product of the voltage and capacity of reversible Li insertion/extraction into/from the electrodes. It will be difficult to design a better anode than carbon, but carbon requires formation of an SEI layer, which involves an irreversible capacity loss. The design of a cathode composed of environmentally benign, low-cost materials that has its electrochemical potential μC well-matched to the HOMO of the electrolyte and allows access to two Li atoms per transition-metal cation would increase the energy density, but it is a daunting challenge. Two redox couples can be accessed where the cation redox couples are “pinned” at the top of the O 2p bands, but to take advantage of this possibility, it must be realized in a framework structure that can accept more than one Li atom per transition-metal cation. Moreover, such a situation represents an intrinsic voltage limit of the cathode, and matching this limit to the HOMO of the electrolyte requires the ability to tune the intrinsic voltage limit. Finally, the chemical compatibility in the battery must allow a long service life.},

The development of cathode materials is needed to compose battery systems. However, the design principles of the cathode materials have not been determined. We focus on the high capacity FeS2 cathode materials and investigate the discharge/charge reaction mechanisms in chloroaluminate ionic liquids as the electrolyte at 55°C. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements are performed for the discharged and charged samples. S 3p-orbitals are shown to play an important role in the redox reactions from the results of the S and Fe K-edge XANES spectra. As a result of the redox reaction, FeS2 is transformed into low crystalline FeS and amorphous Al2S3, as shown by the XRD and S, Al, and Fe K-edge XANES spectra. This reaction mechanism is different from the reaction observed with lithium ion.},

A novel rechargeable aluminum-ion battery based on Al3+ intercalation and deintercalation is fabricated with Ni3S2/graphene microflakes composite as cathode material and high-purity Al foil as anode. This kind of aluminum-ion battery comprises of an electrolyte containing AlCl3 in an ionic liquid of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([EMIm]Cl). Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements have been performed in a voltage range of 0.1–2.0 V versus Al/AlCl4
−. An initial discharge specific capacity of 350 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 is achieved, and the discharge capacity remains over 60 mA h g−1 and coulombic efficiency of 99\% after 100 cycles. Typically, for the current density at 200 mA g−1, the initial charge and discharge capacities are 300 and 235 mA h g−1, respectively. More importantly, it should be emphasized that the battery has a high discharge voltage plateau (≈1.0 V vs Al/AlCl4
−). These meaningful results represent a significant step forward in the development of aluminum-ion batteries.},

	abstract = {The thermodynamic properties of magnesium make it a natural choice for use as an anode material in rechargeable batteries, because it may provide a considerably higher energy density than the commonly used lead–acid and nickel–cadmium systems. Moreover, in contrast to lead and cadmium, magnesium is inexpensive, environmentally friendly and safe to handle. But the development of Mg batteries has been hindered by two problems. First, owing to the chemical activity of Mg, only solutions that neither donate nor accept protons are suitable as electrolytes; but most of these solutions allow the growth of passivating surface films, which inhibit any electrochemical reaction. Second, the choice of cathode materials has been limited by the difficulty of intercalating Mg ions in many hosts. Following previous studies of the electrochemistry of Mg electrodes in various non-aqueous solutions, and of a variety of intercalation electrodes, we have now developed rechargeable Mg battery systems that show promise for applications. The systems comprise electrolyte solutions based on Mg organohaloaluminate salts, and MgxMo 3S4 cathodes, into which Mg ions can be intercalated reversibly, and with relatively fast kinetics. We expect that further improvements in the energy density will make these batteries a viable alternative to existing systems.},

	abstract = {An aluminum-ion asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled utilizing a cathode made of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in an ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([EMIm]Cl)-based electrolyte. Two types of energy-storage mechanisms, that is, electrochemical double-layer capacitance (adsorption/desorption of AlCl4− on the surface) and limited intercalation pseudocapacitance (intercalation/deintercalation of AlCl4− in the graphite layer) at low current density, were observed and characterized. Meanwhile, the specific capacitance and cyclic stability of this supercapacitor were also evaluated by using galvanostatically charging–discharging. The result demonstrates that the specific capacitance decreases with increasing current density, which corresponds to the two types of energy-storage mechanisms of this device. The corresponding retention rate of this device after 3500 cycles at current density of 0.4 A g−1 was 82.4 \%, which shows good cyclic stability.},

Different types of capacitors with a pure electrostatic attraction and/or pseudocapacitance effects are presented. Their performance in various electrolytes is studied taking into account the different range of operating voltage (1 V for aqueous and 3 V for aprotic solutions). Trials are undertaken for estimating the role of micro and mesopores during charging the electrical double layer in both kinds of electrolytic solutions for which the electrical conductivity and the size of solvated ions are different. The effect of pseudocapacitance for maximising the total capacitance is especially documented. Carbons chemically modified by a strong oxidation treatment represent a very well defined region of pseudocapacitance properties due to the Faradaic redox reactions of their rich surface functionality. Conducting polymers (polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene derivatives) and oxidised metallic particles (Ru, Mn, Co,…) deposited on the carbons also participate in the enhancement of the final capacity through fast faradaic pseudocapacitance effects. Evaluation of capacitor performance by different techniques, e.g. voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy, charge/discharge characteristics is also discussed.},

Increasingly more researchers are focusing on harvesting and converting solar energy, mechanical vibration, waste heat, and wind to electricity. Electrical energy storage technologies play a significant role in the demand for green and sustainable energy. Rechargeable batteries or secondary batteries, such as Li-ion batteries, Na-ion batteries, and Mg-ion batteries, reversibly convert between electrical and chemical energy via redox reactions, thus storing the energy as chemical potential in their electrodes. The energy density of a rechargeable battery is determined collectively by the specific capacity of electrodes and the working voltage of the cell, which is the differential potential between the cathode and the anode. Over the past decades, a significant number of studies have focused on enhancing this specific capacity; however, studies to understand and manipulate the electrochemical potential of the electrode materials are limited. In this review, the material characteristics that determine and influence the electrochemical potentials of electrodes are discussed. In particular, the cathode materials that convert electricity and chemical potential through electrochemical intercalation reactions are investigated. In addition, we summarize the selection criteria for elements or compounds and the effect of the local atomic environment on the discharge potential, including the effects of site energy, defects, crystallinity, and microstructure, using LiMn2O4, V2O5, Mo6S8, LiFePO4, and LiCoO2 as model samples for discussion.},

However, some technical and scientific problems preventing the large-scale development of Al–air batteries have not yet to be resolved. In this review, we present the fundamentals, challenges and the recent advances in Al–air battery technology from aluminum anode, air cathode and electrocatalysts to electrolytes and inhibitors. Firstly, the alloying of aluminum with transition metal elements is reviewed and shown to reduce the self-corrosion of Al and improve battery performance. Additionally for the cathode, extensive studies of electrocatalytic materials for oxygen reduction/evolution including Pt and Pt alloys, nonprecious metal catalysts, and carbonaceous materials at the air cathode are highlighted. Moreover, for the electrolyte, the application of aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes in Al–air batteries are discussed. Meanwhile, the addition of inhibitors to the electrolyte to enhance electrochemical performance is also explored. Finally, the challenges and future research directions are proposed for the further development of Al–air batteries.},

The unique properties are due to the high density of Li ions firmly adsorbed over nitrogen triangular holes. The gravimetric and volumetric densities of hydrogen in Li2C3N4 and Li2C4N3 are greater than 10 wt \% and 100 g/L, respectively, both exceeding the target set by the U.S. Department of Energy. Similarly, single-layer Li2C3N4 is a good candidate for a lithium-ion anode material with a specific capacity almost twice that of graphite, and bulk LiC4N3 can be used as a cathode material with a specific energy twice that of LiCoO2. The materials have the added advantage that they are stable against clustering of Li and are nontoxic.},

The epoxy groups of graphene oxide (GO) undergo a nucleophilic substitution reaction with dicyandiamide (C2H4N4) to form the C2H4N4–GO composite via a covalent C–N bond, and then both the in situ polymerization of C2H4N4 and the thermal reduction of GO can be achieved at higher temperatures, forming the covalently coupled g-C3N4–rGO. FT-IR, CP-MAS NMR and XPS analyses, clearly revealed a covalent interaction between the g-C3N4 and rGO sheets. The g-C3N4–rGO exhibits an unprecedented high, stable and reversible capacity of 1525 mA h g−1 at a current density of 100 mA g−1 after 50 cycles. Even at a large current density of 1000 mA g−1, a reversible capacity of 943 mA h g−1 can still be retained. The superior electrochemical performance of g-C3N4–rGO is attributed to the specific characteristics of the unique nanostructure of g-C3N4–rGO and the concerted effects of g-C3N4 and rGO, including covalent interactions between the two moieties, the good conductivity and high special surface area of the nanocomposite, as well as the template effect of the planar amino group of g-C3N4 for the dispersed decoration of Li+ ions.},

	abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have dominated the portable electronics industry and solid-state electrochemical research and development for the past two decades. In light of possible concerns over the cost and future availability of lithium, sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and other new technologies have emerged as candidates for large-scale stationary energy storage. Research in these technologies has increased dramatically with a focus on the development of new materials for both the positive and negative electrodes that can enhance the cycling stability, rate capability, and energy density. Two-dimensional (2D) materials are showing promise for many energy-related applications and particularly for energy storage, because of the efficient ion transport between the layers and the large surface areas available for improved ion adsorption and faster surface redox reactions. Recent research highlights on the use of 2D materials in these future ‘beyond-lithium-ion’ battery systems are reviewed, and strategies to address challenges are discussed as well as their prospects.},

Currently, there is an increasing demand for efficient, low-cost, light-weight, flexible and environmentally benign, small-, medium-, and large-scale energy storage devices, which can be used to power smart grids, portable electronic devices, and electric vehicles. Novel electrode materials, with a high energy density at high power are urgently needed for realizing high-performance energy storage devices. The recent development in the field of 2D materials, including both graphene and other layered systems, has shown promise for a wide range of applications. In particular, graphene analogues, due to their remarkable electrochemical properties, have shown great potential in energy-related applications. This review aims at providing an overview of current research and important advances on the development of 2D materials beyond graphene for supercapacitors and batteries.

For lithium-ion batteries, oxidative corrosion of an Al current collector has been a great challenge in designing new electrolyte materials, and only a few lithium salts (e.g. LiPF6) are in practical use. The present work shows effective suppression of Al corrosion up to 4.5 V versus Li+/Li by using a highly concentrated electrolyte of lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide (LiFSA). The corrosion prevention mechanism can be interpreted in relation to a remarkable change in solution structures at a certain threshold concentration. It is demonstrated that highly concentrated LiFSA/acetonitrile electrolyte enables highly reversible charge–discharge cycling of a 4 V-class LiMn2O4/Li cell at a higher rate (ca. 50 \% capacity retention at 20 C compared to C/2) than a state-of-the-art commercial electrolyte ({\textless}20 \%), thus providing a new design strategy for electrolyte materials in high-rate lithium-ion batteries.},

The eight possible stereoisomers of each series were systematically investigated under strictly aprotic conditions that allowed the observation of up to four and five subsequent reversible reductions in 3 and 4, respectively. Because of the stabilizing effect of positive charges, a significant enhancement of the electronegative properties was observed in 4. In fact, 4-trans-2 and 4-trans-1 result among the strongest reversible electron-accepting C60 oligoadducts. Furthermore, the study evidenced that, in both 3 and 4, the CV pattern, and in particular the potential separation between the second and third reductions, changes significantly with the addition pattern. A sequential π-electron model that simulates the effect of subsequent reductions of C60 bis-adducts gives a good correlation (r {\textgreater} 0.96) with the cyclic voltammetry data when the molecules are divided in two sets dependent on the location of the addends in the same or in opposite hemispheres.},

The effects of the content of graphene on the structure of MoSe2-graphene composites are investigated and the results indicate a suitable proportion of MoSe2 and graphene (7:1) is more beneficial to the charge transport and ion transfer owing to formation of unique porous layered structure. In this composite, abundant graphene nanosheets cover on the surface and interspace of MoSe2 bars homogeneously, leading to large specific surface area and plenty of macropores. As the electrode material of supercapacitors, the composites display a high specific capacitance of 1422Fg−1 and retain the specific capacitance of 100.7\% after 1500 cycles. As expected, after charged at a current density of 5Ag−1, the composites can light up a miniature bulb for more than 70seconds. Moreover, the as-prepared materials exhibit a good catalytic activity toward the electrochemical oxidation of dopamine with a linear range of 0.01-10μM and the detection limit of 1.0nM in terms of the role of signal to noise ratio of 3:1 (S/N=3).

	abstract = {The quest for low-cost and large-scale stationary storage of electricity has led to a surge of reports on novel batteries comprising exclusively highly abundant chemical elements. Aluminum-based systems, inter alia, are appealing because of the safety and affordability of aluminum anodes. In this work, we examined the recently proposed aluminum–ionic liquid–graphite architecture. Using 27Al nuclear magnetic resonance, we confirmed that AlCl4– acts as an intercalating species. Although previous studies have focused on graphitic cathodes, we analyzed the practicality of achievable energy densities and found that the AlCl3-based ionic liquid is a capacity-limiting anode material. By focusing on both the graphitic cathode and the AlCl3-based anode, we improved the overall energy density. First, high cathodic capacities of ≤150 mAh g–1 and energy efficiencies of 90\% at high electrode loadings of at least 10 mg cm–2 were obtained with natural, highly crystalline graphite flakes, which were subjected to minimal mechanical processing. Second, the AlCl3 content in the ionic liquid was increased to its maximal value, which essentially doubled the energy density of the battery, resulting in a cell-level energy density of ≤62 Wh kg–1. The resulting batteries were also characterized by high power densities of at least 489 W kg–1.},

In this work, we demonstrate that synthetic kish graphite, which is a byproduct of steelmaking, can be used as a cathode in AlCl3-GB and exhibits high capacities of ≤142 mAh g(-1). The comprehensive characterization of kish graphite flakes and other forms of graphite by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis provides solid evidence that the exceptional electrochemical behavior of kish graphite flakes is mainly determined by the high structural order of carbon atoms, a low level of defects, and a unique "crater morphology". In view of the nonrocking chair operation mechanism of AlCl3-GB, we have tested the achievable energy densities as a function of the composition of chloroaluminate ionic liquid (AlCl3 content) and have obtained energy densities of up to 65 Wh kg(-1). In addition, the kish graphite flakes can rapidly charge and discharge, offering high power densities of up to 4363 W kg(-1).},

Electrochemical analysis demonstrates that in a current density of 1.6 A/g, the Li+ intercalation capacity of Ni−V2O5·nH2O nanocable array is approximately 10 times higher than that of single-crystal V2O5 nanorod array and 20 times higher than that of sol−gel-derived V2O5 film. Both energy density and power density of such nanocable-array electrodes are higher than the V2O5 film electrode by at least 1 order of magnitude.

	abstract = {Recently, Li−S batteries with a high theoretical specific energy have attracted significant attention. However, their practical application is still seriously hindered by the shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in the Li−S batteries system. Introducing anchoring materials into the cathode or separator, which can strongly attract LiPSs because of advisable binding energies, has been demonstrated as an effective strategy to alleviate the shuttling effect for achieving the excellent cycling performance of Li−S batteries. In this work, the complete mechanistic understanding of the interaction between non-metallic monolayer materials (N-MMLMs, including Graphene, BN, C2N and C3N4) and LiPSs is given in detail with the aid of density functional theory. The calculation results show that N-MMLM can combine the chemical interaction and the physical entrapment of sulfur species to suppress the shuttling effect. C3N4 and C2N are predicted to trap LiPSs via stronger interfacial interaction and alleviate the interactions between LiPSs and solvents as well as the consequent dissolution. The strong anchoring effect of C3N4/C2N comes from the bonding of Li−N/C−S and charge transfer. Further charge transfer study reveals that the C3N4/C2N can serve as an electrocatalyst, which effectively accelerates the kinetics of LiPSs redox reactions.},

Introducing anchoring materials, which can induce strong binding interaction with Li2Sn species, has been demonstrated as an effective way to overcome this problem and achieve long-term cycling stability and high-rate performance. The interaction between Li2Sn species and anchoring materials should be studied at the atomic level in order to understand the mechanism behind the anchoring effect and to identify ideal anchoring materials to further improve the performance of Li–S batteries. Using first-principles approach with van der Waals interaction included, we systematically investigate the adsorption of Li2Sn species on various two-dimensional layered materials (oxides, sulfides, and chlorides) and study the detailed interaction and electronic structure, including binding strength, configuration distortion, and charge transfer. We gain insight into how van der Waals interaction and chemical binding contribute to the adsorption of Li2Sn species for anchoring materials with strong, medium, and weak interactions. We understand why the anchoring materials can avoid the detachment of Li2S as in carbon substrate, and we discover that too strong binding strength can cause decomposition of Li2Sn species.},

In this review, recent progresses in the rational design and synthesis of diverse MMS-based micro/nanostructures with controlled morphologies, sizes, and compositions for LIBs, SIBs, HSCs, MABs, and water splitting are summarized. In particular, nanostructuring, synthesis of nanocomposites with carbonaceous materials and fabrication of 3D MMS-based electrodes are demonstrated to be three effective approaches for improving the electrochemical performance of MMS-based electrode materials. Furthermore, some potential challenges as well as prospects are discussed to further advance the development of MMS-based electrode materials for next-generation electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems.},

	abstract = {A significant percentage of the global energy demand is expected to be met through widespread supply of renewable electricity in the near future. However, renewable energy outputs are variable due to a stochastic characteristic of their sources. Electrical power system operators around the world are faced with difficulties of integrating these variable power sources into the existing power grids. Energy storage systems are one of the possible solutions for mitigating the effects of intermittent renewable resources on networks, allowing increased renewable energy utilization, and providing flexibility and ancillary services for managing future electricity supply/demand challenges. This paper presents a comprehensive review of energy storage technologies that are currently engaged for power applications, including pumped hydro, compressed-air, battery, flywheel, capacitor, supercapacitor, superconducting magnetic and thermal systems. The study compares the characteristics of these systems, and presents their technological development status and capital costs. Some directions for future work are also highlighted.

	abstract = {Graphite and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) are two prominent members of the family of layered materials possessing a hexagonal lattice structure. While graphite has nonpolar homonuclear C–C intralayer bonds, h-BN presents highly polar B–N bonds resulting in different optimal stacking modes of the two materials in the bulk form. Furthermore, the static polarizabilities of the constituent atoms considerably differ from each other, suggesting large differences in the dispersive component of the interlayer bonding. Despite these major differences, both materials present practically identical interlayer distances. To understand this finding, a comparative study of the nature of the interlayer bonding in both materials is presented. A full lattice sum of the interactions between the partially charged atomic centers in h-BN results in vanishingly small contributions to the interlayer binding energy. Higher order electrostatic multipoles, exchange, and short-range correlation Kohn–Sham contributions are found to be very similar in both materials and to almost completely cancel out by the kinetic energy term, which partly represents the effects of Pauli repulsions, at physically relevant interlayer distances, resulting in a marginal effective contribution to the interlayer binding. Further analysis of the dispersive energy term reveals that despite the large differences in the individual atomic polarizabilities, the heteroatomic B–N C6 coefficient is very similar to the homoatomic C–C coefficient in the hexagonal bulk form, resulting in very similar dispersive contribution to the interlayer binding. The overall binding energy curves of both materials are thus very similar, predicting practically the same interlayer distance and very similar binding energies. The conclusions drawn here regarding the role of electrostatic interactions between partially charged atomic centers for the interlayer binding of h-BN are of a general nature and are expected to hold true for many other polar layered systems.},

The proposed potential contains Coulombic and Lennard-Jones 6–12 terms, and is calibrated with recent experimental data including the hexagonal boron nitride interlayer distance and elastic constants. The potentials are evaluated by comparing the experimental and simulated values of interlayer distance, density, elastic constants, and thermal conductivity using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics. The proposed potential is found to be in reasonable agreement with experiments, and improves on earlier potentials in several respects. Simulated thermal conductivity values as a function of the number of layers and of temperature suggest that the proposed LJ 6–12 potential has the ability to predict some phonon behaviour during heat transport in the out-of-plane direction.},

A key aspect to further development could be the combination of aluminum with charge storage materials like conductive polymers in non-aqueous electrolytes taking advantage of the properties of each material.

Subsequently, a novel highly stable polyacrylonitrile (PAN) separator obtained by the electrospinning technique for application in high-performance aluminum batteries has been prepared. The developed PAN separator has been fully characterized in terms of morphology, thermal stability, and air permeability, revealing its suitability as a separator for battery applications. Furthermore, extremely good compatibility and improved aluminum interface stability in the highly reactive EMIMCl:AlCl3 electrolyte were discovered. The use of the PAN separator strongly affects the aluminum dissolution/deposition process, leading to a quite homogeneous deposition compared to that of a glass fiber separator. Finally, the applicability of the PAN separator has been demonstrated in aluminum/graphite cells. The electrochemical tests evidence the full compatibility of the PAN separator in aluminum cells. Furthermore, the aluminum/graphite cells employing the PAN separator are characterized by a slightly higher delivered capacity compared to those employing glass fiber separators, confirming the superior characteristics of the PAN separator as a more reliable separator for the emerging aluminum battery technology.},

In this contribution, exceptional graphene nanosheet (GN) papers that are well stacked by conductive graphene nanosheets have been demonstrated as an electrochemically stable host for fast AlCl4- ion transport/storage along with high volumetric/areal energy storage at a dense state (1.6{\textasciitilde}1.8gcm−3). Owing to the exclusive morphological and chemical advantages, the as-assembled AIBs with the binder-free GN paper cathode enables to deliver considerably high specific capacity 100mAhg−1 at the current density 50mAg−1 (approaching the theoretic value of carbon AIB cathodes), coupled with much enhanced volumetric capacity, areal energy density and power density compared to the reported carbon AIB cathodes. Particularly, the term of tortuosity has been employed to understand the fundamental relationship between volumetric energy performance and microscopic structures, which suggests a unique platform for developing advanced practical AIBs.},

This raises an interesting problem concerning how the AlCl4 clusters can diffuse so fast in the graphite cathode. In this paper, we first demonstrate by means of density functional theory calculations that AlCl4 cluster exists in graphite with planar quadrangle geometry, rather than a tetrahedral structure. Upon AlCl4 intercalation, the interlayer spacing distance between graphene layers is substantially enlarged from 3.353Å to 6.025Å. With such a large spacing, the AlCl4 diffusion becomes very easy with migration energy barriers ranging from 0.023 to 0.089eV for different migration paths in a 2-dimensional diffusion plane. These results give underlying explanation to the dynamic performance of the graphite-based Al-ion batteries.},

The lowest electrical volume resistivity and highest compressibility were found for C-NERGY™ Super C45 dry-mixed with LiCoO2 powder. Mixing by high shear forces in acetone dispersion improved the electrical resistivity and compressibility of the C-NERGY™ Super C65 containing LiCoO2 mixture to the same level obtained for the C-NERGY™ Super C45 mixture in the same process. Acetone dispersions of C-NERGY™ Super C45 and LiCoO2 showed the lowest viscosities attributed to the carbon black's specific BET surface area of 45m2g−1 being the lowest of all carbon blacks studied. The easy dispersibility of C-NERGY™ Super C45 in LiCoO2 could be explained by its particular surface group chemistry characterized by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. The electrical volume resistivity of the LiCoO2/carbon black mixtures was in line with the high current rate performance of half-cells with related LiCoO2 electrodes. Compared to the investigated carbon blacks, the electrical volume resistivity of the graphite conductive additives C-NERGY™ KS6L and C-NERGY™ SFG6L at different concentrations in LiCoO2 powders showed higher critical volume fractions but lower ultimate resistivity levels. Adding one of these graphites to the carbon black conductive mass improved the electrode density and, at concentrations above the critical volume fraction of the graphite component, significantly decreased the ultimate resistivity level of the LiCoO2 electrode mass.},

The rechargeable aluminum/sulfur (Al/S) battery is of great interest owing to its high energy density (1340 Wh kg−1) and low cost. However, Al/S chemistry suffers poor reversibility owing to the difficulty of oxidizing AlSx. Herein, we demonstrate the first reversible Al/S battery in ionic-liquid electrolyte with an activated carbon cloth/sulfur composite cathode. Electrochemical, spectroscopic, and microscopic results suggest that sulfur undergoes a solid-state conversion reaction in the electrolyte. Kinetics analysis identifies that the slow solid-state sulfur conversion reaction causes large voltage hysteresis and limits the energy efficiency of the system.},

Cycling of the conducting polymer electrodes occurred via the electrochemical insertion and removal of these anions. Stable galvanostatic cycling of polypyrrole and polythiophene cells was demonstrated, with electrode capacities at near-theoretical levels (30–100 mAh g–1) and Coulombic efficiencies approaching 100\%. The energy density of a sealed sandwich-type cell with polythiophene at the positive electrode was estimated to be 44 Wh kg–1 relative to the total mass of active components.

	abstract = {Electrical power generation is changing dramatically across the world because of the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to introduce mixed energy sources. The power network faces great challenges in transmission and distribution to meet demand with unpredictable daily and seasonal variations. Electrical Energy Storage (EES) is recognized as underpinning technologies to have great potential in meeting these challenges, whereby energy is stored in a certain state, according to the technology used, and is converted to electrical energy when needed. However, the wide variety of options and complex characteristic matrices make it difficult to appraise a specific EES technology for a particular application. This paper intends to mitigate this problem by providing a comprehensive and clear picture of the state-of-the-art technologies available, and where they would be suited for integration into a power generation and distribution system. The paper starts with an overview of the operation principles, technical and economic performance features and the current research and development of important EES technologies, sorted into six main categories based on the types of energy stored. Following this, a comprehensive comparison and an application potential analysis of the reviewed technologies are presented.},

Additionally, they are a key element for improving the stability and quality of electrical networks. They add flexibility into the electrical system by mitigating the supply intermittency, recently made worse by an increased penetration of renewable generation. One energy storage technology now arousing great interest is the flywheel energy storage systems (FESS), since this technology can offer many advantages as an energy storage solution over the alternatives. Flywheels have attributes of a high cycle life, long operational life, high round-trip efficiency, high power density, low environmental impact, and can store megajoule (MJ) levels of energy with no upper limit when configured in banks. This paper presents a critical review of FESS in regards to its main components and applications, an approach not captured in earlier reviews. Additionally, earlier reviews do not include the most recent literature in this fast-moving field. A description of the flywheel structure and its main components is provided, and different types of electric machines, power electronics converter topologies, and bearing systems for use in flywheel storage systems are discussed. The main applications of FESS are explained and commercially available flywheel prototypes for each application are described. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research.},

The current lithium ion battery technology is based on insertion-reaction electrodes and organic liquid electrolytes. With an aim to increase the energy density or optimize the other performance parameters, new electrode materials based on both insertion reaction and dominantly conversion reaction along with solid electrolytes and lithium metal anode are being intensively pursued. This article presents an outlook on lithium ion technology by providing first the current status and then the progress and challenges with the ongoing approaches.

	abstract = {In the search for low-cost and large-scale stationary storage of electricity, nonaqueous aluminum chloride-graphite batteries (AlCl3-GBs) have received much attention due to the high natural abundances of their primary constituents, facile manufacturing, and high energy densities. Much research has focused on the judicious selection of graphite cathode materials, leading to the most notable recent advances in the performance of AlCl3-GBs. However, the major obstacle to commercializing this technology is the lack of oxidatively stable, inexpensive current collectors that can operate in chloroaluminate ionic liquids and are composed of earth-abundant elements. This study presents the use of titanium nitride (TiN) as a compelling material for this purpose. Flexible current collectors can be fabricated by coating TiN on stainless steel or flexible polyimide substrates by low-cost, rapid, scalable methods such as magnetron sputtering. When these current collectors are used in AlCl3-GB coin or pouch cells, stable cathodic operation is observed at voltages of up to 2.5 V versus Al3+/Al. Furthermore, these batteries have a high coulombic efficiency of 99.5\%, power density of 4500 W kg−1, and cyclability of at least 500 cycles.},

The use of more expensive lithium precursor materials results in less than 1\% increases in the cost of lithium ion cells considered. Similarly, larger fluctuations in the global lithium price (from \$0 to \$25/kg from a baseline of \$7.50 per kg of Li2CO3) do not change the cost of lithium ion cells by more than 10\%. While this small cost increase will not have a substantial impact on consumers, it could affect the manufacturers of these lithium ion cells, who already operate with small profit margins.},

	abstract = {Metal–air batteries are a well-established technology that can offer high energy densities, low cost and environmental responsibility. Despite these favourable characteristics and utilisation of oxygen as the cathode reactant, these devices have been limited to primary applications, due to a number of problems that occur when the cell is recharged, including electrolyte loss and poor efficiency. Overcoming these obstacles is essential to creating a rechargeable metal–air battery that can be utilised for efficiently capturing renewable energy. Despite the first metal–air battery being created over 100 years ago, the emergence of reactive metals such as lithium has reinvigorated interest in this field. However the reactivity of some of these metals has generated a number of different philosophies regarding the electrolyte of the metal–air battery. Whilst much is already known about the anode and cathode processes in aqueous and organic electrolytes, the shortcomings of these electrolytes (i.e. volatility, instability, flammability etc.) have led some of the metal–air battery community to study room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) as non-volatile, highly stable electrolytes that have the potential to support rechargeable metal–air battery processes. In this perspective, we discuss how some of these initial studies have demonstrated the capabilities of RTILs as metal–air battery electrolytes. We will also show that much of the long-held mechanistic knowledge of the oxygen electrode processes might not be applicable in RTIL based electrolytes, allowing for creative new solutions to the traditional irreversibility of the oxygen reduction reaction. Our understanding of key factors such as the effect of catalyst chemistry and surface structure, proton activity and interfacial reactions is still in its infancy in these novel electrolytes. In this perspective we highlight the key areas that need the attention of electrochemists and battery engineers, in order to progress the understanding of the physical and electrochemical processes in RTILs as electrolytes for the various forms of rechargeable metal–air batteries.},

	abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries are becoming increasingly important for electrifying the modern transportation system and, thus, hold the promise to enable sustainable mobility in the future. However, their large-scale application is hindered by severe safety concerns when the cells are exposed to mechanical, thermal, or electrical abuse conditions. These safety issues are intrinsically related to their superior energy density, combined with the (present) utilization of highly volatile and flammable organic-solvent-based electrolytes. Herein, state-of-the-art electrolyte systems and potential alternatives are briefly surveyed, with a particular focus on their (inherent) safety characteristics. The challenges, which so far prevent the widespread replacement of organic carbonate-based electrolytes with LiPF6 as the conducting salt, are also reviewed herein. Starting from rather “facile” electrolyte modifications by (partially) replacing the organic solvent or lithium salt and/or the addition of functional electrolyte additives, conceptually new electrolyte systems, including ionic liquids, solvent-free, and/or gelled polymer-based electrolytes, as well as solid-state electrolytes, are also considered. Indeed, the opportunities for designing new electrolytes appear to be almost infinite, which certainly complicates strict classification of such systems and a fundamental understanding of their properties. Nevertheless, these innumerable opportunities also provide a great chance of developing highly functionalized, new electrolyte systems, which may overcome the afore-mentioned safety concerns, while also offering enhanced mechanical, thermal, physicochemical, and electrochemical performance.},

The increasing reliability of Li ion batteries makes them natural candidates as power sources for electric vehicles. However, their current energy density, which can reach an average of 200 Wh kg−1 on the single cell level, limits the possible driving range of electric cars propelled by Li-ion batteries. Thereby, there is a strong driving force to develop power sources technologies beyond Li-ion batteries that will mark breakthroughs in energy density capabilities. Li-sulfur batteries have high theoretical energy density that can revolutionize electrochemical propulsion capability. Consequently, in recent years there has been much work throughout the world related to these systems. The scope of work on this topic justifies frequent publications of review articles that summarize recent extensive work and provide guidelines and direction for focused future work. Here, a comprehensive, systematic work related to Li-sulfur battery systems is described, beginning with the Li anode challenges, carbon-encapsulated sulfur cathodes, and various kinds of relevant electrolyte solutions. Based on the work described and parallel recent studies by other groups, important and comprehensive guidelines for further research and development efforts in this field are provided.},

The crystallographic information on the subject of graphite is scanty. It has generally been accepted as hexagonal with a well-marked basal cleavage; but besides the cleavage face few other faces have ever been observed on it. Kenngott, the earliest observer, seems to have obtained the best crystal, and measured planes, to which he gave the indices 10͞11 and 11͞21, making angles of 58° and 70° 18' respectively with the basal plane 0001. (These results are strikingly confirmed by X-ray measurements, which make the corresponding angles 58° 8' and 70° 13'.) Nordenskiöld considered graphite monoclinic, on account of the variability of its angles; but his conclusions were questioned by Sjögren, who, in a very full paper, adduced a number of reasons (twinning, percussion and etch figures, thermal conductivity) to show that it was hexagonal. Quite recently the researches of Gaubert have added a knowledge of the optical properties of graphite. In very thin flakes it is transparent, uniaxial and negatively birefringent, with a refractive index of about 2. This settles definitely that it has trigonal hexagonal symmetry. The X-ray analysis of graphite has lagged considerably behind that of the diamond. Bragg in 1914 made a measurement of the spacing of the cleavage planes, finding it to be 3·42 A. U., while Ewald, in the same year, took a Laue photograph of a crystal, perpendicular to the axis, confirming its hexagonal symmetry. The fuller interpretation of its structure was attempted by Hull and by Debye and Scherrer in 1917 by the powder method. Both were able to assign a structure to the element, but these structures have different lattices and belong to different crystal systems. An examination of the original papers shows that the observations of neither investigator are in very good agreement with the structure they propose, and the observations only show the roughest agreement with each other. This is especially marked in the matter of intensities. On the whole, Hull’s results are more plausible, because he separated the Kα and Kβ lines of Mo by screening, whereas Debye and Scherrer often mistook α for β lines, as will be shown subsequently. Since then Backhurst has made some measurements on graphite, from the point of view of its expansion and the effect of temperature on the reflection intensities.},

The oxidation and reduction potentials of the constituent cation and anion of each ionic liquid with respect to a Li+/Li reference electrode were calculated using density functional theory following the method of thermodynamic cycles, and the electrochemical stability windows (ESW)s of these ionic liquids were obtained. The effect of varying the length of alkyl side chains of the methylimidazolium-based cations on the redox potentials and ESWs was investigated. The results show that the limits of the ESWs of these methylimidazolium-based ionic liquids are defined by the oxidation potential of the anions and the reduction potential of alkyl-methylimidazolium cations. Moreover, ionic liquids with [PF6]− anion have a wider ESW. In addition to characterizing structure–function relationships, the accuracy of the computational approach was assessed through comparisons of the data against experimental measurements of ESWs. The potentials calculated by the thermodynamic cycle method are in good agreement with the experimental data while the HOMO/LUMO method overestimates the redox potentials. This work demonstrates that these approaches can provide guidance in selecting ionic liquid electrolytes when designing high-voltage rechargeable batteries.},

During discharge, a cell plates the metal of an anode of high-energy Fermi level such as lithium or sodium onto a cathode current collector with a low-energy Fermi level; the voltage of the cell may be determined by a cathode redox center having an energy between the Fermi levels of the anode and that of the cathode current collector. This strategy is demonstrated with a solid electrolyte that not only is wet by the metallic anode, but also has a dielectric constant capable of creating a large electric-double-layer capacitance at the two electrode/electrolyte interfaces.

However, lithium-ion batteries for vehicles have high capacity and large serial-parallel numbers, which, coupled with such problems as safety, durability, uniformity and cost, imposes limitations on the wide application of lithium-ion batteries in the vehicle. The narrow area in which lithium-ion batteries operate with safety and reliability necessitates the effective control and management of battery management system. This present paper, through the analysis of literature and in combination with our practical experience, gives a brief introduction to the composition of the battery management system (BMS) and its key issues such as battery cell voltage measurement, battery states estimation, battery uniformity and equalization, battery fault diagnosis and so on, in the hope of providing some inspirations to the design and research of the battery management system.},

The discovery of the system dates back to earlier work by Asahi Kasei in Japan, which used a combination of lower temperature carbons for the negative electrode to prevent solvent degradation and lithium cobalt dioxide modified somewhat from Goodenough's earlier work. The development by Sony was carried out within a few years by bringing together technology in film coating from their magnetic tape division and electrochemical technology from their battery division. The past 25 years has shown rapid growth in the sales and in the benefits of lithium ion in comparison to all the earlier rechargeable battery systems. Recent work on new materials shows that there is a good likelihood that the lithium ion battery will continue to improve in cost, energy, safety and power capability and will be a formidable competitor for some years to come.},

	abstract = {Due to increasing concerns about global warming, greenhouse gas emissions, and the depletion of fossil fuels, the electric vehicles (EVs) receive massive popularity due to their performances and efficiencies in recent decades. EVs have already been widely accepted in the automotive industries considering the most promising replacements in reducing CO2 emissions and global environmental issues. Lithium-ion batteries have attained huge attention in EVs application due to their lucrative features such as lightweight, fast charging, high energy density, low self-discharge and long lifespan. This paper comprehensively reviews the lithium-ion battery state of charge (SOC) estimation and its management system towards the sustainable future EV applications. The significance of battery management system (BMS) employing lithium-ion batteries is presented, which can guarantee a reliable and safe operation and assess the battery SOC. The review identifies that the SOC is a crucial parameter as it signifies the remaining available energy in a battery that provides an idea about charging/discharging strategies and protect the battery from overcharging/over discharging. It is also observed that the SOC of the existing lithium-ion batteries have a good contribution to run the EVs safely and efficiently with their charging/discharging capabilities. However, they still have some challenges due to their complex electro-chemical reactions, performance degradation and lack of accuracy towards the enhancement of battery performance and life. The classification of the estimation methodologies to estimate SOC focusing with the estimation model/algorithm, benefits, drawbacks and estimation error are extensively reviewed. The review highlights many factors and challenges with possible recommendations for the development of BMS and estimation of SOC in next-generation EV applications. All the highlighted insights of this review will widen the increasing efforts towards the development of the advanced SOC estimation method and energy management system of lithium-ion battery for the future high-tech EV applications.},

Because vehicles that get some or all of their power from an electric drivetrain can have low or even zero emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and urban air pollutants, and can consume little or no petroleum, there is considerable interest in developing and evaluating advanced electric vehicles (EVs), including pure battery-electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel-cell electric vehicles.

The nanosheets are ideally suited for low (down to 0 °C) through high (100 °C) temperature ionic-liquid-based supercapacitor applications: At 0 °C and a current density of 10 A g–1, the electrode maintains a remarkable capacitance of 106 F g–1. At 20, 60, and 100 °C and an extreme current density of 100 A g–1, there is excellent capacitance retention (72–92\%) with the specific capacitances being 113, 144, and 142 F g–1, respectively. These characteristics favorably place the materials on a Ragone chart providing among the best power–energy characteristics (on an active mass normalized basis) ever reported for an electrochemical capacitor: At a very high power density of 20 kW kg–1 and 20, 60, and 100 °C, the energy densities are 19, 34, and 40 Wh kg–1, respectively. Moreover the assembled supercapacitor device yields a maximum energy density of 12 Wh kg–1, which is higher than that of commercially available supercapacitors. By taking advantage of the complex multilayered structure of a hemp bast fiber precursor, such exquisite carbons were able to be achieved by simple hydrothermal carbonization combined with activation. This novel precursor-synthesis route presents a great potential for facile large-scale production of high-performance carbons for a variety of diverse applications including energy storage.},

	abstract = {Exploring suitable electrode materials is a fundamental step toward developing Al batteries with enhanced performance. In this work, we explore using density functional theory calculations the feasibility of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) as a cathode material for Al batteries. Carbon nanotubes with hollow structures and large surface area are able to overcome the difficulty of activating the opening of interlayer spaces as observed in graphite electrode during the first intercalation cycle. Our results show that AlCl4 binds strongly with the SWNT to result in an energetically and thermally stable AlCl4-adsorbed SWNT system. Diffusion calculations show that the SWNT system allows ultrafast diffusion of AlCl4 with a more favorable inner surface diffusion than outer surface diffusion. Our charge-density difference and Bader atomic charge analysis confirm the oxidation of SWNT upon adsorption of AlCl4, which shows a similar behavior to the previously studied graphite cathode. The average open-circuit voltage and AlCl4 storage capacity increases with increasing SWNT diameter and can be as high as 1.96 V and 275 mA h g−1 in (25,25) SWNT relative to graphite (70 mA h g−1). All of these properties show that SWNTs are a potential cathode material for high-performance Al batteries and should be explored further.},

The anode consisted of interconnected carbon nanoparticles self-assembled onto a nickel foam substrate, providing easy electrolyte access throughout the electrode. The unique 3D electrode architecture prevented deformation of the electrode during cycling. The absence of binder and conducting additive simplifies the electrode fabrication process, thus lowering the battery fabrication costs. As a proof of concept, the anode when tested against lithium delivered a specific discharge capacity of 764 mA h g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1, with an exceptional cycling stability at high current rates (e.g., delivering a capacity of 664 mA h g−1 at 500th cycle at a current density of 1 A g−1). Furthermore, the anode was also tested against sodium, exhibiting a reversible discharge capacity of 241 mA h g−1 in the second cycle at a current density of 50 mA g−1 and remained stable over prolonged cycling.

Super-P (30 nm) and Lonza-KS6 (6 μm) were selected as the components for the binary conductive agents. The total amount and the ratio of the two components of the binary conductive agents were varied. At a fixed Lonza/Super-P ratio of 1:1, the cathode with the higher conductive agent content showed a lower electrical resistance and a lower density, which resulted in better rate and cycling characteristics. However, this advantage was somewhat offset by the decrease of energy density. At a fixed binary conductive agent content of 8 wt.\%, the electrode density increased and the surface electrode resistance decreased with increasing Super-P content. In spite of the decreased ionic diffusion rate, the charge transfer resistance was decreased and the rate capability was increased with increasing Super-P content, which indicated that the formation of effective electronic conduction paths was highly important. The SEM microscopic observation and measurement of planar density of LiCoO2 indicate that the addition of a small amount of Lonza-KS6 provides a uniform dispersion of LiCoO2 particles in the cathode. As a consequence, the cell with the binary conductive agent at an appropriate Lonza/Super-P ratio had a better cycle life than those with single conductive agents.},

	abstract = {The future of electrochemical energy storage hinges on the advancement of science and technology that enables rechargeable batteries that utilize reactive metals as anodes. With specific capacity more than ten times that of the LiC6 anode used in present-day lithium-ion batteries, cells based on Li-metal anodes are of particular interest. Effective strategies for stabilizing the anode in such cells are now understood to be a requirement for progress on exceptional storage technologies, including Li–S and Li–O2 batteries. Multiple challenges—parasitic reactions of Li-metal with liquid electrolytes, unstable and dendritic electrodeposition, and dendrite-induced short circuits—derailed early efforts to commercialize such lithium-metal batteries. Here we consider approaches for rationally designing electrolytes and Li-metal/electrolyte interfaces for stable, dendrite-free operation of lithium-metal batteries. On the basis of fundamental understanding of the failure modes of reactive metal anodes, we discuss the key variables that govern the stability of electrodeposition at the Li anode and propose a universal framework for designing stable electrolytes and interfaces for lithium-metal batteries.},

We design a “trihigh tricontinuous” (3H3C) graphene film cathode with features of high quality, orientation, and channeling for local structures (3H) and continuous electron-conducting matrix, ion-diffusion highway, and electroactive mass for the whole electrode (3C). Such a cathode retains high specific capacity of around 120 mAh g−1 at ultrahigh current density of 400 A g−1 (charged in 1.1 s) with 91.7\% retention after 250,000 cycles, surpassing all the previous batteries in terms of rate capability and cycle life. The assembled aluminum-graphene battery works well within a wide temperature range of −40 to 120°C with remarkable flexibility bearing 10,000 times of folding, promising for all-climate wearable energy devices. This design opens an avenue for a future super-batteries.

	abstract = {Rechargeable aluminum batteries (Al batteries) can potentially be safer, cheaper, and deliver higher energy densities than those of commercial Li-ion batteries (LIBs). However, due to the very high charge density of Al3+ cations and their strong interactions with the host lattice, very few cathode materials are known to be able to reversibly intercalate these ions. Herein, a rechargeable Al battery based on a two-dimensional (2D) vanadium carbide (V2CTx) MXene cathode is reported. The reversible intercalation of Al3+ cations between the MXene layers is suggested to be the mechanism for charge storage. It was found that the electrochemical performance could be significantly improved by converting multilayered V2CTx particles to few-layer sheets. With specific capacities of more than 300 mAh g–1 at high discharge rates and relatively high discharge potentials, V2CTx MXene electrodes show one of the best performances among the reported cathode materials for Al batteries. This study can lead to foundations for the development of high-capacity and high energy density rechargeable Al batteries by showcasing the potential of a large family of intercalation-type cathode materials based on MXenes.},

We explore the influence of the type of anodic material (aluminium, stainless steel and carbon) and its 3D geometry on the reversibility of the anodic reaction by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge. The shape of the CVs confirms that electrodeposition of aluminium was feasible in the three materials but the highest peak currents and smallest peak separation in the CV of the aluminium anode suggested that this material was the most promising. Interestingly, carbon-based substrates appeared as an interesting alternative due to the high peak currents in CV, moderate overpotentials and dual role as anode and cathode. 3D substrates such as fiber-based carbon paper and aluminium mesh showed significantly smaller overpotentials and higher efficiencies for Al reaction suggesting that the use of 3D substrates in full batteries might result in enhanced power. This is corroborated by polarization testing of full Al-batteries.},

Among them, Al-ion batteries based on aluminum anode and graphite carbon cathode have gained lots of interests as one of the most promising technologies. Here, it is demonstrated that the size of graphitic material in ab plane and c direction plays an important role in anion intercalation chemistry. Sharply decreasing the size of vertical dimension (c direction) strongly facilitates the kinetics and charge transfer of anions (de)intercalation. On the other hand, increasing the size of horizontal dimension (ab plane) contributes to improving the flexibility of graphitic materials, which results in raising the cycling stability. Meanwhile, chloroaluminate anions are reversibly intercalated into the interlayer of graphite materials, leading to the staging behaviors. In the end, an ultrafast Al-ion battery with exceptional long life is achieved based on large-sized few-layer graphene as a cathode and aluminum metal as an anode.},

It is found that not only AlCl4− but also Al3+ could also be intercalated and deintercalated into the prelithium graphite electrode material. The CV result clearly shows that the Graphite-Li electrode material has two pairs of redox peaks, which can be attributed to the AlCl4− and Al3+ intercalation and deintercalation into the electrode materials, respectively. In addition, the discharge specific capacity of Graphite-Li (68.2 mAh g−1) is significantly higher than Graphite (49.2 mAh g−1) at the currert density of 200 mA g−1. The discharge capacity of Graphite-Li can still reach 64 mAh g−1 even after 500 cycles with a coulombic efficiency close to 100\%. Such remarkable electrochemical performance is attributed to the fact that the interlayer spacing is improved by prelithiation treatment which reduces the electrostatic effect between Al3+ or AlCl4− and electrode materials.},

	abstract = {With revolutionary electric vehicles and the smart grid fast developing, more advanced energy storage technologies become quite crucial issues. Li-ion batteries (LIBs) and Na-ion batteries (NIBs) are considered as the most promising electrochemical energy storage technologies. Low-dimensional nano-structural electrode materials can greatly increase the specific capacity, but they still suffer from poor cycling and rate performances due to their serious self-aggregations. Constructing 3D structures, such as micro/nano-structures and free-standing electrodes, is a quite promising method to address the above issues. Such 3D structures can simultaneously avoid the disadvantages of low-dimensional nanomaterials, and preserve their advantages. As one group of promising high-capacity and low-cost electrode materials, vanadium-based oxides have exhibited an quite attractive electrochemical performance for energy storage applications in many novel works. However, their systematic reviews are quite limited, which is disadvantageous to their further development. Herein, this article provides an overview of vanadium-based oxides in the applications of LIBs and NIBs by focusing mainly on the aspect from low-dimensional nanomaterials synthesis to 3D micro/nano-structures and free-standing electrodes fabrication. Moreover, a feasible strategy to controllably fabricate the 3D micro/nano-structure for the whole vanadium-based oxides family is presented. Furthermore, and importantly, a quite promising solution method for the practical commercialized applications of vanadium oxides cathode materials in the future is proposed, i.e., fabricating the “vanadium oxides-based cathode/solid electrolyte/Li metal anode-type” all solid-state secondary-ion batteries.},

We exclude the possibility of Al3+ cation intercalation into graphite as in standard Li-ion batteries. Instead, we show that the AlCl4- anion intercalation mechanism is thermodynamically feasible. By including the ionic liquid electrolyte in the overall redox reaction, we are able to reproduce the high voltage observed in experiment. The active involvement of electrolyte in the reaction suggests that the evaluation of energy density needs to take the electrolyte into consideration. Our proposed structural model is consistent with the new peaks appearing in X-ray diffraction from the intercalation compound. The high rate capability is explained by the ultralow diffusion barriers of the AlCl4 intercalant. With the clarified working mechanism, it becomes clear that the high voltage of the Al-graphite cell is a result of the thermodynamic instability of the AlCl4-intercalated graphite. © 2017 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Aluminum metal foil is the optimal choice as an anode material for aluminum-ion batteries for its key advantages such as high theoretical capacity, safety, and low cost. However, the metallic nature of aluminum foil is very likely to induce severe dendrite growth with further electrode disintegration and cell failure, which is inconsistent with previous reports. Here, we discover that it is aluminum oxide film that efficiently restricts the growth of crystalline Al dendrite and thus improves the cycling stability of Al anode. The key role of surficial aluminum oxide film in protecting Al metal anode lies in decreasing the nucleation sites, controlling the metallic dendrite growth, and preventing the electrode disintegration. The defect sites in aluminum oxide film provide channels for electrolyte infiltration and further stripping/depositing. Attributed to such a protective aluminum oxide film, the Al–graphene full cells can attain up to 45 000 stable cycles.},

	abstract = {Recent progresses in the field of Al-ion batteries have given directions to look for new electrode materials that can lead toward the enhancement of battery performance. Using the dispersion-corrected density functional theory calculations, we have examined the applicability of hexagonal BC3 as a cathode material for Al-ion battery by evaluating its stability, specific capacity, and voltage profile diagram of AlCl4-intercalated hexagonal BC3. Our results show that AlCl4-intercalated BC3 compounds are stable. We have found that there is a significant charge transfer from the BC3 system to AlCl4 indicating toward the oxidation of BC3 upon intercalation reaction. Several low-energy pathways are observed for the diffusion process, and it is observed that the AlCl4 diffusion is trouble-free in the two-dimensional plane of BC3, having a diffusion barrier as low as 0.38 eV. Moreover, we have observed that BC3 can provide a higher average voltage 2.41 V and specific capacity of 74.37 mAh/g. These findings suggest that BC3 could be a promising cathode material for Al-ion batteries.},

The battery comprises a molten sodium anolyte and a molten NaAl2Cl7 catholyte, separated by a NaSICON solid Na+ electrolyte. It is operated at 200 °C to overcome the ceramic separator kinetics and to keep sodium and NaAl2Cl7 in the molten state.

However, rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) using Al metal as anode display poor cycling performances owing to interface problems between anode and electrolyte. The solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the anode has been confirmed to be essential for improving cycling performances of rechargeable batteries. Therefore, we immerse the Al metal in ionic liquid electrolyte for some time before it is used as anode to remove the passive film and expose fresh Al to the electrolyte. Then the reactions of exposed Al, acid, oxygen and water in electrolyte are occurred to form an SEI layer in the cycle. Al/electrolyte/V2O5 full batteries with the thin, uniform and stable SEI layer on Al metal anode perform high discharge capacity and coulombic efficiency (CE). This work illustrates that an SEI layer is formed on Al metal anode in the cycle using a simple and effective pretreatment process and results in superior cycling performances for RABs.},

Microstructural characterization revealed uniform distribution of nano-BN particulates and marginal grain refinement. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) value of the magnesium matrix was improved with the addition of nano-sized BN particulates. The results of XRD studies indicate basal texture weakening with an increase in nano-BN addition. The composites showed improved mechanical properties measured under micro-indentation, tension and compression loading. While the tensile yield strength improvement was marginal, a significant increase in compressive yield strength was observed. This resulted in the reduction of tension-compression yield asymmetry and can be attributed to the weakening of the strong basal texture.},

In this work, we report the synthesis of large-area h-BN film using atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition on a copper foil, followed by Cu etching and transfer to a target substrate. The growth rate of h-BN film at a constant temperature is strongly affected by the concentration of borazine as a precursor and the ambient gas condition such as the ratio of hydrogen and nitrogen. h-BN films with different thicknesses can be achieved by controlling the growth time or tuning the growth conditions. Transmission electron microscope characterization reveals that these h-BN films are polycrystalline, and the c-axis of the crystallites points to different directions. The stoichiometry ratio of boron and nitrogen is close to 1:1, obtained by electron energy loss spectroscopy. The dielectric constant of h-BN film obtained by parallel capacitance measurements (25 μm2 large areas) is 2–4. These CVD-grown h-BN films were integrated as a dielectric layer in top-gated CVD graphene devices, and the mobility of the CVD graphene device (in the few thousands cm2/(V·s) range) remains the same before and after device integration.},

	abstract = {The controlled exfoliation of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) into single- or few-layered nanosheets remains a grand challenge and becomes the bottleneck to essential studies and applications of h-BN. Here, we present an efficient strategy for the scalable synthesis of few-layered h-BN nanosheets (BNNS) using a novel gas exfoliation of bulk h-BN in liquid N2 (L-N2). The essence of this strategy lies in the combination of a high temperature triggered expansion of bulk h-BN and the cryogenic L-N2 gasification to exfoliate the h-BN. The produced BNNS after ten cycles (BNNS-10) consisted primarily of fewer than five atomic layers with a high mass yield of 16–20 \%. N2 sorption and desorption isotherms show that the BNNS-10 exhibited a much higher specific surface area of 278 m2 g−1 than that of bulk BN (10 m2 g−1). Through the investigation of the exfoliated intermediates combined with a theoretical calculation, we found that the huge temperature variation initiates the expansion and curling of the bulk h-BN. Subseqently, the L-N2 penetrates into the interlayers of h-BN along the curling edge, followed by an immediate drastic gasification of L-N2, further peeling off h-BN. This novel gas exfoliation of high surface area BNNS not only opens up potential opportunities for wide applications, but also can be extended to produce other layered materials in high yields.},

	abstract = {Few-layered boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) have attracted increasing research interest in the past few years due to their unique material properties. However, the lack of a reliable scale-up production method is an inhibiting issue for their practical applications. In this work, we report a facile one-step and high-yield method for the synthesis of few-layered and hierarchically porous BNNSs through simultaneous etching and in situ nitridation of calcium hexaboride (CaB6) by ammonium chloride under moderate conditions. The output of the few-layered BNNSs is as high as 1.4 g with respect to 1.06 g of starting CaB6 crystals. Transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy characterizations confirm the successful synthesis of few-layered BNNSs, most of which are layered with a thickness less than 3 nm (layer number {\textless} 10). The as-prepared BNNSs exhibit a high specific surface area (492–795 m2 g−1) and a high pore volume (0.34–0.50 cm3 g−1). In addition, the as-resulted BNNSs exhibit high and tuneable H2 uptakes from 1.48 to 2.18 wt\% at 77 K and at a relatively low pressure of 1.0 MPa, thus guiding the further search of materials for H2 storage. Our results suggest that the simultaneous etching and in situ nitridation of metallic borides is a facile and effective method for reliable production of few-layered BNNSs with hierarchical porosity for potential applications such as gas storage and functional composites.},

	abstract = {Two dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (2D-hBN), an isomorph of graphene with a very similar layered structure, is uniquely featured by its exotic opto-electrical properties together with mechanical robustness, thermal stability, and chemical inertness. It is thus extensively studied for application in field effect transistors (FETs), tunneling devices, deep UV emitters and detectors, photoelectric devices, and nanofillers. 2D-hBN is considered as one of the most promising materials that can be integrated with other 2D materials, such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), for the next generation microelectronic and other technologies. Although it is by itself an insulator, it can well be tuned by several strategies in terms of properties and functionalities, such as by doping, substitution, functionalization and hybridization, making 2D-hBN a truly versatile type of functional materials for a wide range of applications. In this review, the distinct structural characteristics of 2D-hBN, doping- and defect-induced variations in energy bands and structures, and resultant properties, are presented. There are a wide variety of processing routes that have been developed for 2D-hBN, including also those for doping, substitution, functionalization and combination with other materials to form heterostructures or h-BNC hybrid nanosheets, which are systematically elaborated for novel functions. The comprehensive overview provides the types of the state-of-the-art 2D-hBN made by new synthesis strategies, where the mainstream approaches include exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition, and gas phase epitaxy, together with several other new methods that have been successfully developed in the past few years. On the basis of the extraordinary electrical and functional properties and thermal–mechanical stability, the applications of hBN-based nanosheets as substrates and dielectrics, passivation layers, and nanofillers in nanodevices and nanocomposites are discussed, together with the peculiar optical and wetting characteristics.},

Exfoliated hBN was shown to be stable in solvents such as ethanol, acetone, deionized water and isopropyl alcohol, and this stability was linked to sulfur functionalization that was induced during the exfoliation process. Further evidence of the functionalization was observed using transmission electron spectroscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). By deconvoluting the high resolution peaks for B 1s, the bonding of boron to oxygen and sulfur was confirmed. The exfoliated hBN nanosheets were crystalline as confirmed from X-ray diffraction and they also exhibited an optically active defect related to sulfur functionalization at 320 nm (3.9 ± 0.1 eV).},

Comprehensive high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman characterizations all confirm that the obtained BN phase is partially disordered, shows an enlarged average spacing between adjacent (0002) layers (d0002 = 0.38 nm, compared to normal 0.33 nm for a bulk layered BN), and belongs to an intermediate state between hexagonal (h-BN) and amorphous (a-BN) phases. By changing the synthesis temperatures, the textures of obtained porous microbelts are adjustable.

	abstract = {The pressing need for low-cost and large-scale stationary storage of electricity has led to a new wave of research on novel batteries made entirely of components that have high natural abundances and are easy to manufacture. One example of such an anode–electrolyte–cathode architecture comprises metallic aluminum, AlCl3:[EMIm]Cl (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride) ionic liquid and graphite. Various forms of synthetic and natural graphite cathodes have been tested in recent years in this context. Here, a new type of compelling cathode based on inexpensive pyrene polymers is demonstrated. During charging, the condensed aromatic rings of these polymers are oxidized, which is accompanied by the uptake of aluminum tetrachloride anions (AlCl4−) from the chloroaluminate ionic liquid. Discharge is the fast inverse process of reduction and the release of AlCl4−. The electrochemical properties of the polypyrenes can be fine-tuned by the appropriate chemical derivatization. This process is showcased here by poly(nitropyrene-co-pyrene), which has a storage capacity of 100 mAh g−1, higher than the neat polypyrene (70 mAh g−1) or crystalline pyrene (20 mAh g−1), at a high discharge voltage (≈1.7 V), energy efficiency (≈86\%), and cyclic stability (at least 1000 cycles).},

	abstract = {The structure of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is similar to that of graphite before functionalization and exfoliation. For applications in polymer nanocomposites, chemical exfoliation is a more economically attractive route to few-layer h-BN nanosheets. A thermal oxidation process of h-BN powder could achieve large scale exfoliation and hydroxylated functionalization, as described in prior literature. In this report, hydroxylated h-BN (BNO) was prepared by heating h-BN under air, and then covalently incorporated into epoxy resin modified with (3-isocyanatopropyl)triethoxysilane to prepare epoxy resin (EP) nanocomposites by sol–gel process. The structure and morphology of BNO were well characterized. BNO was dispersed in the EP matrix with the form of mainly exfoliated and intercalated structures, and formed strong interfacial interaction with the matrix. Thermogravimetric analysis results revealed that BNO significantly improved thermal stability and thermal oxidative resistance of EP nanocomposites at high temperature. The char yield and the temperature at 50 wt\% mass loss were increased and the maximum mass loss rate was remarkably reduced. Moreover, the addition of 3 wt\% BNO led to extremely high Tg of EP nanocomposite, 42.7 °C higher than that of pure EP, due to improved crosslinking density and confinement effect of BNO sheets on the mobility of polymer networks. Cone calorimeter test results indicated that fire safety properties of EP nanocomposites were also enhanced by the addition of BNO, such as 53.1\% reduction in peak heat release rate and 32.6\% decrease in total heat release, and decreased release of smoke and toxic gases. The mechanism for enhanced fire retardancy is that thermally stable condensed barrier consisting of h-BN sheets and silicon dioxide for heat and mass transfer protects the matrix from further combustion.},

Against this background, the present study deals with the development of a high-thermal-conductivity, low-dielectric-constant, and low-loss polymer nanocomposite based on silver nanoparticle (AgNP)-decorated boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) as the filler in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix. The nanocomposites were prepared through a facile solution-blending process. Elemental mapping of the prepared nanocomposite indicates the uniform distribution of filler particle in PMMA matrix. An impressive high-thermal conductivity (TC) enhancement of around 363\% was achieved for nanocomposite of 0.35 Vf of hybrid filler (1.48 W/m K) compared to pristine PMMA (0.32 W/m K). The addition of AgNP reduces the thermal contact resistance (Rc) by bridging individual BNNS, thereby improving thermal transport. Measured TC values were fitted with a theoretical model that showed good agreement. Dielectric measurements performed at radiofrequencies and microwave frequencies revealed that the nanocomposites show a low dielectric constant ({\textless}5), low loss (10–2), and very low alternating current conductivity (10–7 S/cm). The results suggest that silver-decorated BNNS is a promising hybrid filler for effective thermal management.},

The colloidal solutions of few-layer h-BN can have unprecedentedly high concentrations, up to 30 mg ml−1, and are stable for up to several months. They can be used to produce ultralight aerogels with a density of 1.4 mg cm−3, which is ∼1,500 times less than bulk h-BN, and freestanding membranes simply by cryodrying and filtration, respectively.

	abstract = {Abstract Crystalline 2D hexagonal Boron Nitride (2D?hBN) is explored as a potential electrocatalyst towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) when electrically wired via a drop?casting approach upon a range of carbon based electrode surfaces; namely, glassy carbon (GC), boron?doped diamond (BDD), and screen?printed graphitic electrodes (SPEs). We consider the ORR in acidic conditions and critically evaluate the performance of unmodified and 2D?hBN modified electrodes, implementing coverage studies (commonly neglected in the literature) in order to ascertain the true impact of this novel nanomaterial. The behaviour of 2D?hBN towards the ORR is shown to be highly dependent upon both the underlying carbon substrate and the coverage/mass utilised. 2D?hBN modified SPEs are found to exhibit the most beneficial response towards the ORR, reducing the peak potential by ca. 0.28?V when compared to an unmodified/bare SPE. Such improvements at this supporting substrate are inferred due to favourable 2D?hBN interaction with ridged surfaces exposing a high proportion of edge regions/sites, where conversely, we show that relatively smooth substrate surfaces (such as GC) are less conducive towards successful 2D?hBN immobilisation. In this paper, we reveal for the first time (in the specific case of using a rough supporting substrate) that 2D?hBN gives rise to beneficial electrochemical behaviour towards the ORR. Unfortunately, this material is not considered an electrocatalyst for use within fuel cells given that the estimated number of electrons transferred during the ORR ranges between 1.90?2.45 for different coverages, indicating that the ORR at 2D?hBN predominantly produces hydrogen peroxide. 2D?hBN does however have potential and should be explored further by those designing, fabricating and consequently electrochemically testing modified electrocatalysts towards the ORR.},

The surface area of BN increases progressively with the decreasing number of layers, and the high surface area BN exhibits high CO2 adsorption, but negligible H2 adsorption. Few-layer BN has been solubilized by interaction with Lewis bases. We have used first-principles simulations to determine structure, phonon dispersion, and elastic properties of BN with planar honeycomb lattice-based n-layer forms. We find that the mechanical stability of BN with respect to out-of-plane deformation is quite different from that of graphene, as evident in the dispersion of their flexural modes. BN is softer than graphene and exhibits signatures of long-range ionic interactions in its optical phonons. Finally, structures with different stacking sequences of BN have comparable energies, suggesting relative abundance of slip faults, stacking faults, and structural inhomogeneities in multilayer BN.},

X?ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron energy?loss spectroscopy reveal the composition to be close to BCN. The X?ray diffraction pattern, high?resolution electron microscopy images and Raman spectrum indicate the presence of graphite?type layers with low sheet?to?sheet registry. Atomic force microscopy reveals the sample to consist of two to three layers of BCN, as in a few?layer graphene. BCN exhibits more electrical resistivity than graphene, but weaker magnetic features. BCN exhibits a surface area of 2911?m2?g?1, which is the highest value known for a BxCyNz composition. It exhibits high propensity for adsorbing CO2 (≈100?wt?\%) at 195?K and a hydrogen uptake of 2.6?wt?\% at 77?K. A first?principles pseudopotential?based DFT study shows the stable structure to consist of BN3 and NB3 motifs.

However, various adsorbates become trapped between layers during their assembly, and this not only affects the resulting quality but also prevents the formation of a true artificial layered crystal upheld by van der Waals interaction, creating instead a laminate glued together by contamination. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has shown that graphene and boron nitride monolayers, the two best characterized 2D crystals, are densely covered with hydrocarbons (even after thermal annealing in high vacuum) and exhibit only small clean patches suitable for atomic resolution imaging6,7,8,9,10. This observation seems detrimental for any realistic prospect of creating van der Waals materials and heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces. Here we employ cross sectional TEM to take a side view of several graphene–boron nitride heterostructures. We find that the trapped hydrocarbons segregate into isolated pockets, leaving the interfaces atomically clean. Moreover, we observe a clear correlation between interface roughness and the electronic quality of encapsulated graphene. This work proves the concept of heterostructures assembled with atomic layer precision and provides their first TEM images.},

The search for new battery materials together with the drive to improve performance and lower cost of existing and new batteries is not without its challenges. Success in these matters is undoubtedly based on first understanding the underlying chemistries of the materials and the relations between the components involved. A combined application of experimental and theoretical techniques has proven to be a powerful strategy to gain insights into many of the questions that arise from the “how do batteries work and why do they fail” challenge. In this Review, we highlight the application of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in battery research: a technique that can be extremely powerful in characterizing local structures in battery materials, even in highly disordered systems. An introduction on electrochemical energy storage illustrates the research aims and prospective approaches to reach these. We particularly address “NMR in battery research” by giving a brief introduction to electrochemical techniques and applications as well as background information on both in and ex situ solid-state NMR spectroscopy. We will try to answer the question “Is NMR suitable and how can it help me to solve my problem?” by shortly reviewing some of our recent research on electrodes, microstructure formation, electrolytes and interfaces, in which the application of NMR was helpful. Finally, we share hands-on experience directly from the lab bench to answer the fundamental question “Where and how should I start?” to help guide a researcher’s way through the manifold possible approaches.},

The investigation was conducted on aluminum rotating disk electrodes as a function of potential, ionic liquid composition, and temperature. Two different dissolution mechanisms were realized. At modest overpotentials, dissolution takes place under mixed kinetic-mass transport control. However, as the overpotential is increased to induce higher dissolution rates and/or the ionic liquid is made more acidic, the dissolution reaction transitions to a potential-independent passivation-like process ascribed to the formation of a porous solid layer of AlCl3(s). At a fixed temperature and composition, the limiting passivation current density displays Levich behavior and also scales linearly with the concentration of AlCl4− in the ionic liquid. The heterogeneous kinetics of the Al dissolution reaction were measured in the active dissolution potential regime. The exchange current densities were independent of the composition of the ionic liquid, and the anodic transfer coefficients were close to zero and seemed to be independent of the Al grain size.},

The dynamic conditions inside a working battery had not been intensively explored until the advent of various in situ characterization techniques. Real-time transmission electron microscopy of electrochemical reactions is one of the most significant breakthroughs poised to enable radical shift in our knowledge on how materials behave in the electrochemical environment. This review, therefore, summarizes the scientific discoveries enabled by in situ transmission electron microscopy, and specifically emphasizes the applicability of this technique to address the critical challenges in the rechargeable ion battery electrodes, electrolyte and their interfaces. New electrochemical systems such as lithium–oxygen, lithium–sulfur and sodium ion batteries are included, considering the rapidly increasing application of in situ transmission electron microscopy in these areas. A systematic comparison between lithium ion-based electrochemistry and sodium ion-based electrochemistry is also given in terms of their thermodynamic and kinetic differences. The effect of the electron beam on the validity of in situ observation is also covered. This review concludes by providing a renewed perspective for the future directions of in situ transmission electron microscopy in rechargeable ion batteries.},

Excellent stability with capacity 680 mAh g−1 at 0.5C (1C = 718 mA g−1) is achieved after 1000 cycles. Superior rate capability is exhibited by cycling at extremely high current rates, such as 20C and 50C with capacities ca. 164 and 75 mAh g−1, respectively. The capacity can be recovered back to ca. 430 mAh g−1 in 2 cycles when lowered to 0.2C and stably cycled for 430 times with capacity 460 mAh g−1. The NiO nanowire foam anode possesses low equivalent series resistance ca. 3.5 Ω, resulting in superior power performance and low resistive losses. The NiO nanowire foam can be manufactured with bio-friendly chemicals and low temperature processes without any templates, binders and conductive additives, which possesses the potential transferring from lab scale to industrial production.},

	abstract = {Carbonate-based electrolytes used in Li-ion batteries encounter various challenges at extreme electrochemical environments, hence their application calls for the help of various additives, especially when used with high voltage cathode materials. These additives are designed to form protective interphases that prevent parasitic carbonate oxidation, while in certain cases they stabilize electrolytes from reduction at anode surfaces or even serve as flame-retardants that postpone the thermal runaway during overcharge. However, most of these additives are non-solvent to Li-salts, and their excessive use often casts negative effects. An ideal solution of minimizing the presence of these inert molecules is to identify an additive that structurally integrates these multiple functions into a single compound. In this work, we report a novel additive, diethyl (thiophen-2-ylmethyl) phosphonate (DTYP). Its 0.5\% presence in a base electrolyte dramatically improves the capacity retention of a high voltage Li-ion cell using LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 from 18\% to 85\% after 280 cycles at 1 C at 60 oC, raises the endothermic reaction onset temperature from 193 oC to 223 oC, and reduces the self-extinguishing time of the electrolyte from 88 s to 77 s. Thus, such a multifunctional additive presents a cost-efficient solution to the issues often faced in high voltage lithium-ion batteries.},

A wide variety of carbon nanomaterials with different characteristics has played an important role in enhancing the performance of LSBs via immobilizing sulfur in cathodes, accommodating the volume expansion of sulfur, enhancing the reaction kinetics and stabilizing lithium anodes. This report overviews the state-of-the-art progress in designing and fabricating nanocarbon for advanced LSBs with particular focuses on the correlations among porosity, electrical conductivity and surface chemistry as some of the most critical factors. More importantly, statistical analysis of electrochemical performance of batteries collected from literatures allows us to identify substantial disparities between the current achievements and the requirements for real-world applications. In an effort to bridge this gap, we highlight recent advances in the design of LSBs with improved sulfur loading, enhanced charge transfer and minimized electrolyte/sulfur ratio. Conclusions and perspectives for future development of nanocarbon in LSBs are proposed.},

From the early Li-metal anode iterations to the current commercial Li-ion batteries (LIBs), the story of the Li-based battery is full of breakthroughs and back tracing steps. This review will discuss the main roles of material science in the development of LIBs. As LIB research progresses and the materials of interest change, different emphases on the different subdisciplines of material science are placed. Early works on LIBs focus more on solid state physics whereas near the end of the 20th century, researchers began to focus more on the morphological aspects (surface coating, porosity, size, and shape) of electrode materials. While it is easy to point out which specific cathode and anode materials are currently good candidates for the next-generation of batteries, it is difficult to explain exactly why those are chosen. In this review, for the reader a complete developmental story of LIB should be clearly drawn, along with an explanation of the reasons responsible for the various technological shifts. The review will end with a statement of caution for the current modern battery research along with a brief discussion on beyond lithium-ion battery chemistries.},

This review examines the use of vanadium oxide as an electrode material for metal ion batteries with focus on electrospun derivatives. Vanadium oxide-based electrodes are predominantly considered in lithium ion batteries given the amount of published literature in this context. The use of vanadium oxide in energy storage devices, while promising, is limited by its low structural stability and slow electrochemical kinetics associated with charge carrier intercalation resulting in poor cycle stability. Doping with other metallic element and incorporation of carbon derivatives in vanadium oxides can potentially improve its cycle stability and rate retention. Vanadium oxide-based electrodes for sodium ion and aluminium ion batteries are also discussed to highlight its versatility in alternative metal ion battery systems.},

	abstract = {Aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs) are regarded as viable alternatives to lithium-ion technology because of their high volumetric capacity, their low cost, and the rich abundance of aluminum. However, several serious drawbacks of aqueous systems (passive film formation, hydrogen evolution, anode corrosion, etc.) hinder the large-scale application of these systems. Thus, nonaqueous AIBs show incomparable advantages for progress in large-scale electrical energy storage. However, nonaqueous aluminum battery systems are still nascent, and various technical and scientific obstacles to designing AIBs with high capacity and long cycling life have not been resolved until now. Moreover, the aluminum cell is a complex device whose energy density is determined by various parameters, most of which are often ignored, resulting in failure to achieve the maximum performance of the cell. The purpose here is to discuss how to further develop reliable nonaqueous AIBs. First, the current status of nonaqueous AIBs is reviewed based on statistical data from the literature. The influence of parameters on energy density is analyzed, and the current situation and existing problems are summarized. Furthermore, possible solutions and concerns regarding the construction of reliable nonaqueous AIBs are comprehensively discussed. Finally, future research directions and prospects in the aluminum battery field are proposed.},

However, extended application of AIBs requires the development of innovative electrode materials with high energy density, which mainly depends on the cathode materials. In this review, the recent efforts to improve the electrochemical performances of AIBs were introduced. In particular, we provided a critical overview of the effective modification methods related to the cathode materials of AIBs, including carbonaceous materials (graphitic carbons, amorphous carbons, porous carbons), metal oxides (V2O5, VO2, TiO2, MoO2), metal sulphide (FeS2, Mo6S8, SnS2, NiS, CuS) and so on. The synthesis, structure, morphologies and electrochemical performances of these promising cathode materials have been discussed in detail. We anticipate that this review will shed light on the sustainable development of high-performance and low cost AIBs.},

While there are fierce attempts to find suitable electrode materials for aluminum-ion batteries, it is very important to carefully evaluate them. We show here that an essential criterion for correct electrochemical evaluation of aqueous aluminum-ion batteries is to appropriately select the current collector. Considering anatase TiO2 as a model electrode material, it is demonstrated that type of current collector could transform an inactive electrode material to an active one. TiO2 could exhibit initial Al3+ ion storage capacity of 256 mAhg−1 at a current density of 4 Ag−1 with graphite current collector, whereas it is only 82 mAhg−1 with titanium current collector at similar current density. Interestingly, no charge/discharge characteristics could be obtained with stainless steel and nickel current collectors at any current densities.},

	abstract = {The development of efficient Al batteries is hindered by the major challenge of finding advanced electrode materials, which can deliver higher voltage and storage capacities with ultra-fast charge/discharge rates. Herein, the first principle calculations are used to comparatively study the cathode applicabilities of 3D C3N bulk, 2D C3N bilayer and 1D C3N nanotubes for Al batteries and to investigate the effect of the dimensions of the cathode on the electrochemical properties of the battery. We observe that all three phases of C3N behave in a similar way to those of the graphite counterpart by initiating the charge transfer from the C3N system to intercalated AlCl4. However, an improved diffusivity and storage capacity are obtained for the 1D C3N nanotubes and 2D C3N bilayer as compared to those for the 3D C3N bulk phase in the Al battery. A detailed discussion of stability vs. voltage for the AlCl4 intercalated systems reveals the fact that the electron-donating ability of the C3N system, when compared to that of graphite, results in stronger binding between AlCl4 and the C3N system, which results in a lower net voltage in the Al battery. In this regard, a 1D electron-deficient system with adequate stability towards AlCl4 intercalation can be a superior choice to obtain high voltage in Al batteries when compared to that obtained by using graphite. We believe that our present study will be helpful in understanding the working mechanism of Al batteries and the development of high-voltage Al battery electrodes with adequate stability.},

As the research into rechargeable aluminum batteries with a room-temperature ionic liquid electrolyte is relatively new, research efforts have focused on finding suitable electrode materials. An understanding of the environmental aspects of electrode materials is essential to make informed and conscious decisions in aluminum battery development. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the relative environmental performance of electrode material candidates for rechargeable aluminum batteries with an AlCl3/EMIMCl (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride) room-temperature ionic liquid electrolyte. To this end, we used a lifecycle environmental screening framework to evaluate 12 candidate electrode materials. We found that all of the studied materials are associated with one or more drawbacks and therefore do not represent a \&ldquo;silver bullet\&rdquo; for the aluminum battery. Even so, some materials appeared more promising than others did. We also found that aluminum battery technology is likely to face some of the same environmental challenges as Li-ion technology but also offers an opportunity to avoid others.

Yet, most existing aluminum-ion research has focused on electrode materials development and synthesis. There has been a lack of fundamental understanding of the electrode processes and thus theoretical guidelines for electrode materials selection and design. In this study, by using density functional theory, we for the first time report a first-principles investigation on the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of aluminum intercalation into two common TiO2 polymorphs, i.e., anatase and rutile. After examining the aluminum intercalation sites, intercalation voltages, storage capacities and aluminum diffusion paths in both cases, we demonstrate that the stable aluminum intercalation site locates at the center of the O6 octahedral for TiO2 rutile and off center for TiO2 anatase. The maximum achievable Al/Ti ratios for rutile and anatase are 0.34375 and 0.36111, respectively. Although rutile is found to have an aluminum storage capacity slightly higher than anatase, the theoretical specific energy of rutile can reach 20.90 Wh kg−1, nearly twice as high as anatase (9.84 Wh kg−1). Moreover, the diffusion coefficient of aluminum ions in rutile is 10−9 cm2 s−1, significantly higher than that in anatase (10−20 cm2 s−1). In this regard, TiO2 rutile appears to be a better candidate than anatase as an electrode material for aluminum-ion batteries.},

	abstract = {Studies of anode materials due to the rapidly growing demand for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are an active area of research. However, the primary focus is on the specific capacity and cyclability. An essential requirement of electrode materials is the operating voltage, which is defined by the redox potential, but there is a tendency to sacrifice this feature in favor of higher capacities. For the cathode materials, there is a common categorization based on the operating voltage (e.g., high voltage cathode delivering a redox potential between 4.5–5.0V vs. Li/Li+), but there is no such categorization for anode materials. The present manuscript aims to provide a general review of the anode material to highlight the importance of the operating voltage for an anode candidate. Furthermore, it is described that compositing the anode materials with carbon nanomaterials can increase the specific capacity for the delithiation, but part of this capacity is due to the carbon capacitance or pseudocapacitance mostly occurring at high potentials, which cannot be gained in the full cell performance. This class of pseudocapacitive anode materials can be of potential interest for energy storage but not appropriate candidates for the conventional LIBs. It is also emphasized that the delithiation process is the main duty of an anode material when a LIB is working.},

	abstract = {When identical dry Li-ion batteries are filled with different electrolyte solutions, those with higher coulombic efficiency (CE) normally have a longer life-time, provided the batteries have the same test history (storage time and temperature, cycling protocol etc.). Accurate CE measurements can therefore be used to rapidly rank cells according to their life-time without relying on tests that are many years long. The CE of Li-ion cells normally increases with time since SEI layers thicken and parasitic reactions between electrodes and electrolyte, which cause the departure of the CE from unity, slow down. However, in some cases, the CE of Li-ion cells has been observed to be greater than unity and decrease during early charge-discharge cycling, which is unexpected. This anomalous behavior is shown here to be caused by the impact of lithium atoms stored in the negative electrode “overhang”, the small portion of the negative electrode that extends past the positive electrode in commercial Li-ion cells. Storage protocols are discussed that allow CE to more rapidly stabilize with time or cycle number.},

These bands provide information about the chemical composition of sample under investigation and hence can be used as Raman spectral markers for the qualitative monitoring of the pure EO and different fractions containing different active compounds.

In this work, the physicochemical properties of the room temperature ionic liquid composed of aluminum chloride and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([EMIm]Cl) were systematically investigated by varying the molar ratio AlCl3/[EMIm]Cl in the range 1.1–1.7. The combined use of multinuclear (27Al, 13C, 1H) NMR, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and thermal analysis allowed us to shed light on the structure–properties relationships of this complex system, also resolving some controversial conclusions of previous literature. We showed that the 1.2 molar ratio is the best compromise between high ionic conductivity and the use of the highly toxic AlCl3. This electrolyte was tested in a standard Al-ion cell and gave promising results even at very high current densities (i {\textgreater} 200 mA g–1).},

The results showed that the critical passivation potential of Fe shifted to more negative when the molar ratio of AlCl3:EMIC changing from 2 to 1.3. A film with a light yellow color was observed on the surface of the Fe electrode after passivation. The composition of the passive film was demonstrated to be FeCl2. The passive film was composed of particulate FeCl2 with average diameter of about 500 nm. The formation of FeCl2 film was attributed to the variation of the electrolyte Lewis acidity from acidic to neutral at the interface during the dissolution process of Fe. The reason caused the variation of the electrolyte acidity was discussed.},

However, to date, its poor reversibility and low lifespan have limited its practical application. In this paper, a composite cathode is reported for Al–S batteries based on S anchored on a carbonized HKUST-1 matrix (S@HKUST-1-C). The S@HKUST-1-C composite maintains a reversible capacity of 600 mAh g−1 at the 75th cycle and a reversible capacity of 460 mAh g−1 at the 500th cycle under a current density of 1 A g−1, with a Coulombic efficiency of around 95\%. X-ray diffraction and Auger spectrum results reveal that the Cu in HKUST-1 forms S–Cu ionic clusters. This serves to facilitate the electrochemical reaction and improve the reversibility of S during charge/discharge. Additionally, Cu increases the electron conductivity at the carbon matrix/S interface to significantly decrease the kinetic barrier for the conversion of sulfur species during battery operation.},

Cathode materials with both high capacity and rate performance are urgently needed to fulfill such applications. Here, a three-dimensional carbon-encapsulated cobalt selenide nanoparticles are developed from metal organic frameworks as a novel aluminum ion batteries cathode. The cathode material delivers an unprecedented capacity of 427 mAh g−1 at 1000 mA g−1 with two high discharge plateaus at 1.0 V and 1.9 V (equivalent to energy density of 424 Wh kg−1). And even at a very high current density of 5000 mA g−1, the initial discharge capacity of cathode electrode can reach 254.8 mAh g−1, and a high capacity of 62.4 mAh g−1 is retained after 100 cycles. Such outstanding performance are attributed to the well-defined nanostructure of three-dimensional carbon-encapsulated cobalt selenide cathode material.

Additionally, by investigation of failure modes, we provided a hypothesis about the process of formation of local “soft short circuits” in cells with undetectable failure.

	abstract = {Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been the dominating technology for electric vehicles (EV) and grid storage in the current era, but they are still extensively demanded to further improve energy density, power density, and cycle life. Herein, a novel 3D layered nanoarchitecture network of Ni(HCO3)2/rGO composites with highly uniform Ni(HCO3)2 nanocubes (average diameter of 100 ± 20 nm) wrapped in rGO films is facilely fabricated by a one-step hydrothermal self-assembly process based on the electrostatic interaction and coordination principle. Benefiting from the synergistic effects, the Ni(HCO3)2/rGO electrode delivers an ultrahigh capacity (2450 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1), ultrafast rate capability and ultralong cycling stability (1535 mA h g−1 for the 1000th cycle at 5 A g−1, 803 mA h g−1 for the 2000th cycle at 10 A g−1). The detailed electrochemical reaction mechanism investigated by in situ XRD further indicates that the 3D architecture of Ni(HCO3)2/rGO not only provides a good conductivity network and has a confinement effect on the rGO films, but also benefits from the reversible transfer from LiHCO3 to LixC2 (x = 0–2), further oxidation of nickel, and the formation of a stable/durable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film (LiF and LiOH), which are responsible for the excellent storage performance of the Li-ions. This work could shed light on the design of high-capacity and low-cost anode materials for high energy storage in LIBs to meet the critical demands of EV and mobile information technology devices.},

However, the lack of advanced electrode materials greatly affects their applications. Here, layered-structure SbPO4 is explored as an anode material for sodium ion batteries in terms of SbPO4 nanorods on reduced graphene oxide (SbPO4/rGO). In situ transmission electron microscopy images reveal the preferential expansion along the transverse direction of the nanorods upon the first discharging, which arises from the reduction of SbPO4 to Sb and the subsequent alloying of Sb as supported by in situ X-ray diffraction and selected area electron diffraction patterns. SbPO4/rGO exhibits a capacity retention of 99\% after 100 cycles at 0.5 A g–1 both in half cells and in full cells. Its specific capacity at 5 A g–1 is 214 mA h g–1 in half cells or 134 mA h g–1 in full cells. Moreover, the energy density of the full cells at 1.2 kW kg–1total is still 99.8 W h kg–1total, very promising as an advanced electrode material.},

In this work, we report a novel commercial activated amorphous carbon-based anode synthesized through a facile-tailored strategy consisting of annealing and surface coating. The as-prepared amorphous carbon has a porous internal structure but a very low specific surface area (SSA) with a dense surface carbon layer. As an anode material for SIBs, the obtained amorphous carbon displays an outstanding electrochemical performance including a high reversible capacity of 391 mAh g−1 at a current density of 25 mA g−1 with a high ICE of 80\%, and a superior cycling performance with a capacity retention of 97\% after 100 cycles. The high ICE is mainly attributed to the denser surface carbon layer which suppresses the penetration of electrolyte and fully utilizes the internal porosity. The commercial availability, and the desirable properties make this novel amorphous carbon-based anode a promising candidate for SIBs.},

However, the widespread application of these batteries is hindered by organic electrolyte decomposition at high working voltages and the absence of electrode materials allowing for high capacity and long cycle lifetime, which necessitates further investigations toward performance improvement. Herein, we use 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium chloroaluminate (DMPI+)(AlCl4−) as an ionic liquid electrolyte and graphite rods as electrodes to fabricate a DIB with excellent electrochemical performance, revealing that the redox amphotericity of carbon allows the intercalation/deintercalation of both cations and anions into/from the graphite electrodes. The developed DIB is shown to exhibit high discharge voltage plateaus of 4.2–4.0 and 3.6–3.1 V, a reversible specific capacity of ∼80 mAh g−1 at a current density of 300 mA g−1, and a high coulombic efficiency of ∼97\% over 300 cycles. Moreover, the non-flammability and electrochemical stability of the employed electrolyte result in improved safety and performance, allowing the fabricated DIB to function under various critical conditions such as high C-rate charge/discharge, continuous bending, and even burning. Thus, the developed battery is concluded to hold great promise for grid energy storage and other applications.},

	abstract = {The high electron affinity of fullerene C60 coupled with the rich chemistry of carbon makes it a promising material for cathode applications in lithium-ion batteries. Since boron has one electron less than carbon, the presence of boron on C60 cages is expected to generate electron deficiency in C60, and thereby to enhance its electron affinity. By using density functional theory (DFT), we studied the redox potentials and electronic properties of C60 and C59B. We have found that doping C60 with one boron atom results in a substantial increase in redox potential from 2.462 V to 3.709 V, which was attributed to the formation of an open shell system. We also investigated the redox and electronic properties of C59B functionalized with various redox-active oxygen containing functional groups (OCFGs). For the combination of functionalization with OCFGs and boron doping, it is found that the enhancement of redox potential is reduced, which is mainly attributed to the open shell structure being changed to a closed-shell one. Nevertheless, the redox potentials are still higher than that of pristine C60. From the observation that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of closed-shell OCFG- functionalized C59B is correlated well with the redox potential, it was confirmed that the spin state is crucial to be considered to understand the relationship between electronic structure and redox properties.},

The C60 polymer (C60-O) film was also investigated by Raman spectroscopy and imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM) both at the early and advanced polymerization stage. While the spectroelectrochemical behavior of the C60/C60•− couple in the presence of O2 was similar to that in its absence, at more negative potentials corresponding to C602− and O2•− formation C602− participated in a chemical follow-up reaction resulting in a product lacking any diagnostic absorption band in the vis-NIR range. Although the main peak in the MS spectrum of the one-electron reduction product was that of C60 at m/z of 720, several additional peaks in the m/z range of 739−760 appeared, indicating generation of C60O•− and C60O2•− followed by their protonation. Interestingly, the MS spectrum of the product of two-electron reduction of C60 revealed several peaks in the m/z range of 1297−1465. These peaks correspond to the oxygen-containing fullerene protonated dimers, which lose the Cn (n = 1, 2) or C2n (n = 2−5) fragments upon ionization. Apparently, products of the C602− and O2•− interaction spontaneously dimerize in the electrode vicinity. Importantly, oxygen is built into the dimeric molecule in the initial stage of electropolymerization. The Raman spectroscopy measurements and AFM surface imaging of the C60-O film revealed that the first CV cycle resulted in an electrodeposition of dimers. With the increase of the number of CV cycles, the extent of polymerization increased and the polymer structure became highly heterogeneous. Finally, an electrophoretically deposited film of the HiPCO single-wall carbon nanotubes (pyr-SWCNTs) noncovalently surface modified with 1-pyrenebutyric acid was coated by electropolymerization with the C60-O film under CV conditions to result in a polymer−CNT composite material. AFM imaging of this film showed that tangles of the pyr-SWCNTs bundles, coated with the C60-O globules, were formed. The electrochemical and viscoelastic properties of the pyr-SWCNTs{\textbar}C60-O film were unraveled by simultaneously performed CV and piezoelectric microgravimetry (PM) measurements in a blank (TBA)ClO4 acetonitrile solution. Specific capacitance of the electrode coated with this composite film was 184 F g−1, a value comparable to those for other SWNT composite film coated electrodes, suggesting a plausible application of this material in developing supercapacitors.},

	abstract = {The electrochemically active polymers have been formed during electro-reduction carried out in solution containing fullerenes, C60 or C70, and transition metal complexes of Pd(II), Pt(II), Rh(III), and Ir(I). In these films, fullerene moieties are covalently bounded to transition metal atoms (Pd and Pt) or their complexes (Rh and Ir) to form a polymeric network. All films exhibit electrochemical activity at negative potentials due to the fullerene cages reduction process. For all studied metal complexes, yields of formation of films containing C70 are higher than yields of electrodeposition of their C60 analogs. C70 /M films also exhibit higher porosity in comparison to C60/M layers. The differences in film morphology and efficiency of polymer formation are responsible for differences in electrochemical responses of these films in acetonitrile containing supporting electrolyte only. C70/M films shows more reversible voltammeric behavior in negative potential range. They also show higher potential range of electrochemical stability. Processes of film formation and electrochemical properties of polymers depend on the transition metal ions or atoms bonding fullerene cages into polymeric network. The highest efficiency of polymerization was observed for fullerene/Pd and fullerene/Rh films. In the case of fullerene/Pd films, the charge transfer processes related to the fullerene moieties reduction in negative potential range exhibit the best reversibility among all of the studied systems. Capacitance performances of C60/Pd and C70/Pd films deposited on the porous Au/quartz electrode were also compared. Capacitance properties of both films are significantly affected by the conditions of electropolymerization. Only a fraction of the film having a direct contact with solution contributes to pseudocapacitance. Capacitance properties of these films also depend on the size of cations of supporting electrolyte. The C70/Pd film exhibits much better capacitance performance comparison to C60/Pd polymer.},

However, the sulfur cannot serve as cathode individually because of its isolation nature and soluble compounds, which necessitates a second component as a conducting matrix and sulfur host. Thus, sulfur cathodes have diversified through microstructure designing with various materials, including inorganic compounds, polymers, carbon materials, and their hybrids, which should be satisfied several essential requirements, such as high stable incorporation with sulfur, high electrical conductivity of electrode materials, and loose framework to suffer the volume expansion of cathode during charge-discharge process.

	abstract = {Li–S battery is one of the most promising next-generation rechargeable battery technologies because of its high theoretical energy density and low material cost. However, its success is impeded by the low energy efficiency and fast capacity fade primarily caused by the discharge intermediates, Li-polysulfides (PS), dissolution in the electrolyte. Mitigation of PS dissolution in electrolyte involves the search for a new electrolyte solvent system that exhibits poor solvation to the PS while still having good solvation ability to the electrolyte salt for high ionic conductivity. Applying cosolvents with reduced solvating power but compatible with the state of the art Li–S battery’s ether-based electrolyte is one of the most promising concepts. This route is also advantageous of having a low scale-up cost. With the aid of quantum chemical calculation, we have identified high carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio ethers as cosolvent in the new electrolytes that effectively impede PS dissolution while still maintaining high ionic conductivity. Significantly improved cycle life and cycling Coulombic efficiency are observed for Li–S cells using the new composite electrolytes. Anode analysis with different methods also demonstrate that reducing electrolyte’s PS solubility results in less sulfur total amount on the lithium anode surface and lower ratio of the longer-chain PS, which is probably a sign of suppressed side reactions between the anode and PS in the electrolyte.},

In this work, we successfully achieved a low-cost and high-performance AIB system consisting of commercial expanded graphite (EG) cathode and AlCl3-triethylamine hydrochloride (AlCl3-ET) electrolyte. The assembled AIB exhibited the cathode capacity of 78.3 ± 4.1 mAh g−1 (156.6 ± 8.2 mAh cm−3) at 5 A g−1 with 77.5\% retention after 30 000 cycles.

We confirmed the part of the cathode capacity was contributed by AlCl4− deposition, and the reaction mechanism of our new system resulted from the special structure of EG, which served as an important supplement of the classical mechanism of AIB. The high capacity of EG-AIB was contributed by AlCl4− deposition and its stage 4 intercalation. This work provides a very promising and simple strategy for establishing the low-cost, high-performance and high-mass loading AIB system with great commercial value.},

	abstract = {Performance degradation over Li-ion battery lifetime is unavoidable and ultimately rooted in chemical processes. Their extent is mostly determined by battery material components and operation conditions (charge/discharge rates, voltage operation limits and temperature) and can also be influenced by battery design. The two major factors contributing to loss of negative electrode performance are the instability of the passivation layer formed at the electrode/electrolyte interface (enhanced at higher temperatures) and lithium metal plating (intensified at low temperatures). In contrast, capacity fading at the positive electrode mostly results from partial dissolution of the active material during cycling/storage or electrolyte solvent oxidation, which is promoted by temperature and high potential. While it would be most useful to be able to monitor degradation at all levels while the cell is being cycled, the feasibility of this approach remains limited, and most approaches involve accelerated testing with ante/post mortem characterization. Yet, the use of suitable protocols for battery opening and disassembling is crucial to avoid biased interpretation. Finally, the relevance of degradation diagnosis coupled to modelling is also worth mentioning.},

The bulk electrodeposition of aluminum was carried out at a fixed voltage of 1.5 V, temperatures 323 K to 383 K (50 °C to 110 °C), stirring rate (0 to 120 rpm), concentration (molar ratio AlCl3:EMIC = 1.25 to 2.0), and electrode surface modification (modified/unmodified). The study investigated the effect of electrode surface modification, cathode materials, temperature, stirring rate, electrolyte concentration, and deposition time on the deposit morphology of aluminum, cathode current density, and their role in production of dendrite-free aluminum deposit, which is essential for decreasing the production cost. The deposits were characterized using scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). It was shown that electrode surface modification, cathode overpotential, and stirring rate play an important role in dendrite-free deposit. Modified electrodes and stirring (60 rpm) eliminate dendritic deposition by reducing cathode overpotential below critical overpotential (ηcrt≈−0.53Vηcrt≈−0.53V {\textbackslash}eta\_\{{\textbackslash}text\{crt\}\} {\textbackslash}approx - 0.53V ) for dendrite formation. Pure aluminum ({\textgreater}99 pct) was deposited for all experiments with a current efficiency of 84 to 99 pct and energy consumption of 4.51 to 5.32 kWh/kg Al.},

Owing to its low cost, high-rate capability, excellent cyclability, and non-flammability, AIB provides a safe alternative to many commercial batteries used in the energy storage system. To improve its performance, identifying molecular structure and arrangement of chloroaluminate anion (AlCl4−) intercalated in the graphite layer remains a great challenge. In this work, operando analysis of X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement and X-ray absorption (XAS) spectroscopy were performed to investigate the intercalation of AlCl4− anion and related molecular arrangement in the graphite layers. The intercalated stage and intercalant gallery height of graphite cathode electrode during AIB battery operation were observed to be stage 3 and 9.22 Å, respectively. Furthermore, the spectral evolution from ex-situ XAS at the Al and Cl K-edge was associated with closely packed intercalation of AlCl4− molecules. With density functional theory (DFT) calculation, three simulated models of intercalated AlCl4− molecules in the graphite layer were revealed successfully, which explained possible molecular structures at different charging states. This analytical methodology paves the way for better understanding the structural transformation of molecular ions de-/intercalation in graphite layers.},

Electrochemical tests highlighted the significant influence of specific applied potentials on accumulated charge storage densities and on the limits of saturation of larger electrolytes in the pores. Computational analyses corroborated these findings and predicted a 16\% increase in the capacitance of the smaller-cation electrolyte under high applied potentials. However, QENS experiments revealed a behavior of decoupling of alkyl chain dynamics from the ring in electrolytes with larger ions. cDFT calculations identified density spikes for C12mim+ away from the pore walls to further corroborate this unique behavior.

Nevertheless, owing to the inherent gap between theoretical experiments and commercial applications, the storage capacity, battery potential and energy density need to be improved to a large degree. In this regard, attention should be paid to two crucial factors impacting the electrochemical performance, that is the cathode materials and electrolytes. Therefore, this review is focused on a variety of cathode materials, such as transition metal oxides, metal sulfides, carbonaceous materials and other types of materials based on two main electrolyte systems, i.e., the organic system and the aqueous system. In this paper, not only is the working intercalation mechanism comprehensively concluded, but the results of relevant electrochemical experiments for AIBs are also compared and analyzed in detail.

Based on this strategy, poly(ethylene oxide)–intercalated MoS2 composites (PEO–MoS2) were synthesized via a facile exfoliation-restacking method and tested as anode materials for Na-ion batteries (NIBs). The interlayer spacing of MoS2 was increased from 0.615nm to 1.45nm by insertion of controlled amounts of PEO. The bilayer PEO–intercalated MoS2 composite (PEO2L–MoS2) exhibits a specific capacity of 225mAhg−1 under a current density of 50mAg−1, twice as high as that of commercial MoS2 (com-MoS2), and shows improved rate performance due to enhanced Na-ion diffusivity.

	abstract = {Aluminum metal is a high-energy-density carrier with low cost, and thus endows rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) with the potential to act as an inexpensive and efficient electrochemical device, so as to supplement the increasing demand for energy storage and conversion. Despite the enticing aspects regarding cost and energy density, the poor reversibility of electrodes has limited the pursuit of RABs for a long time. Fortunately, ionic-liquid electrolytes enable reversible aluminum plating/stripping at room temperature, and they lay the very foundation of RABs. In order to integrate with the aluminum-metal anode, the selection of the cathode is pivotal, but is limited at present. The scant option of a reliable cathode can be accounted for by the intrinsic high charge density of Al3+ ions, which results in sluggish diffusion. Hence, reliable cathode materials are a key challenge of burgeoning RABs. Herein, the main focus is on the insertion cathodes for RABs also termed aluminum-ion batteries, and the recent progress and optimization methods are summarized. Finally, an outlook is presented to navigate the possible future work.},

	abstract = {As low-cost commercial materials, the application of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the aluminum battery is limited by the lack of active intercalation sites. Herein, a flexible unzipped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (UCNTs) film consisting of graphene nanoribbons and a carbon nanotube backbone is prepared via a simple, low-cost and scalable method for high-performance aluminum battery positive electrode. In the nanostructure, the neonatal graphene nanoribbons provide numerous active intercalation sites to store AlCl4− anions, while the internal core CNTs are responsible for the rapid transportation of electrons to the active sites. Fast transportation of electrons and anions in UCNT film are simultaneously achieved, promoting the kinetics in the aluminum battery. Thus the UCNT-Al battery exhibits a high storage performance with a capacity as high as 100 mA h g−1 (current density: 2000 mA g−1) and a long cycle life of 5600 cycles with a capacity of 75 mA h g−1 (Coulombic efficiency: 98\%) at 5000 mA g−1. Furthermore, the excellent flexibility and fast charging and variable discharging performance are beneficial for the development of portable devices. This work effectively tackles bottleneck caused by the lack of active sites for CNT-based aluminum batteries and accelerates the development of aluminum batteries.},

Its different compounds, such as MoS2/carbon, MoS2/polymer, and MoS2/metal oxides, have also been applied in the field of energy storage, including supercapacitors and batteries. In this review, we summarize the most recent advances made in the last 5 years in the development of MoS2 and MoS2-based composites in various electrochemical domains. In the discussion, emphasis is given to applications in supercapacitors, lithium-ion batteries, and sodium-ion batteries.

However, lithium dendrite growth and infinite volume change during reduplicative plating/stripping processes induce the security issue, low coulombic efficiency and poor cycle performance of lithium metal batteries. Here, with high tensile strength, elasticity and good chemical resistance, glass fiber films are employed as a three-dimensional host of lithium metal anode, on which, golden nanoparticles are coated by cool sputtering to direct the planiform deposition of lithium. Thanks to the effective suppression of lithium dendrite growth, a stable and reversible lithium metal anode is achieved with an average coulombic efficiency of 98.1\% over 400 cycles in ether-based electrolyte (at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 for a total of 1 mAh cm−2 of lithium). Besides, compared with carbon nanofiber films which the voltage hysteresis increased drastically after 50 cycles, glass fiber films exhibit more stable cyclic performance over 200 cycles. Furthermore, a full battery when it is coupled the anode with lithium iron phosphate shows enhanced rate capability and high cycle stability with retention of 95.6\% at 2C over 150 cycles, which demonstrates a promising high-energy and safe rechargeable lithium metal battery.},

This limitation is addressed through the use of graphene-based positive electrodes which can improve the rate capability of these batteries due to their higher conductivity. However, conventional methods of graphene production induce a significant number of defects which impair the performance of AIBs and DIBs. Herein, we report the use of a defect free graphene positive electrode which was produced using electrochemical exfoliation of graphite in an aqueous solution with the aid of Co2+ as an antioxidant. The Co-treated graphene electrode achieved a high capacity of 150 mAh g-1 in DIBs and 130 mAh g-1 in AIBs with high rate capability for both batteries. The charge-discharge mechanism of the batteries is examined using in situ Raman spectroscopy and the results revealed that the intercalation density of [AlCl4] or [PF6] increased from a dilute staging index graphite intercalation compound (GIC) to a stage 1 GIC within the operating voltage window. The simple production method of high-quality graphene in conjunction with its high performance in DIBs should enable the use of graphene for DIB technologies.},

	abstract = {The stability of modern lithium-ion batteries depends critically on an effective solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI), a passivation layer that forms on the carbonaceous negative electrode as a result of electrolyte reduction. However, a nanoscopic understanding of how the SEI evolves with battery aging remains limited due to the difficulty in characterizing the structural and chemical properties of this sensitive interphase. In this work, we image the SEI on carbon black negative electrodes using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and track its evolution during cycling. We find that a thin, primarily amorphous SEI nucleates on the first cycle, which further evolves into one of two distinct SEI morphologies upon further cycling: (1) a compact SEI, with a high concentration of inorganic components that effectively passivates the negative electrode; and (2) an extended SEI spanning hundreds of nanometers. This extended SEI grows on particles that lack a compact SEI and consists primarily of alkyl carbonates. The diversity in observed SEI morphologies suggests that SEI growth is a highly heterogeneous process. The simultaneous emergence of these distinct SEI morphologies highlights the necessity of effective passivation by the SEI, as large-scale extended SEI growths negatively impact lithium-ion transport, contribute to capacity loss, and may accelerate battery failure.},

	abstract = {Raman spectroscopy is one of the most valuable experimental techniques for quality assessment and structural characterization of sample materials. As such, it has been applied to understand the mechanism of the staging of anions and cations into graphite-based electrodes in a variety of energy storage devices such as Al batteries, dual-ion cells, and Li-ion batteries. However, the correlation between the Raman peaks and intercalation stages is still unclear in most of these systems. This is due to the fact that the modeling of electron-phonon coupling in highly doped graphite systems is beyond the standard Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Here, we simulate the Raman peaks for AlCl−4-intercalated graphite in Al batteries by using a nonadiabatic coupling theory. Specifically, we successfully correlate the Raman peaks of the G phonon in AlCl−4-doped graphite with experiment for intercalation stages 1, 2, and 4, while stage 3 appears to be absent. Stages 1 and 2 have not been observed in experimental XRD patterns. We therefore believe that the AlCl−4-graphite intercalation compound has a core-shell structure with a maximum stage of 4 or 3 in the core and 2 or 1 in the shell. In addition, the observed intense narrow Raman bands for the Al-ion battery cathode are due to the high level of graphite doping and are explained in terms of low electron-phonon decay rates.},

Using glucose can limit the growth of the SnO2 particles; as a result, the size of the SnO2 particles would be relatively uniform. Moreover, the carbon coated on the surface of SnO2 particles can effectively prevent their agglomeration on the surface of rGO and limit their volume expansion during charge–discharge cycles. The porous structure of the rGO/PC/SnO2 nanocomposite can effectively accommodate the severe volume variation upon cycling and provide additional contact areas between the active material and the electrolyte. Significantly, the rGO/PC/SnO2 anode delivers an initial specific discharge capacity of 2238.2 mA h g−1 and retains 1467.8 mA h g−1 after 150 cycles at a current density of 0.1C (1C = 782 mA g−1). Even at the high specific current of 1C after 200 cycles, the reversible specific capacity is still as high as 618.3 mA h g−1. The rGO/PC/SnO2 anode exhibits excellent rate performances and possesses a reversible specific capacity of 445.9 mA h g−1 at 5C implying its good structural stability.},

	abstract = {Constructing ordered hierarchical porous structures while maintaining their overall crystalline order is highly desirable but remains an arduous challenge. Herein, we successfully achieve the growth of single-crystalline metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in three-dimensional (3D) ordered macroporous template voids by saturated solution-based double-solvent-assisted strategy with precise control over the nucleation process. The as-prepared single-crystalline ordered macro-microporous Co-based MOFs (SOM ZIF-67) exhibits an ordered macro-microporous structure with robust single crystalline nature. Moreover, SOM ZIF-67 can serve as precursor to derive 3D ordered macroporous cobalt diselenide@carbon (3DOM CoSe2@C) through a facile carbonization-selenization treatment. The as-derived 3DOM CoSe2@C can well preserve the 3D ordered macroporous structure of the precursor. More importantly, CoSe2 nanoparticles could be uniformly confined in the conductive ordered macroporous carbon framework, affording regularly interconnected microporous channels and large surface area. As a result, when evaluated as a cathode material for aluminumion batteries, the ordered macroporous structure could not only effectively facilitate the diffusion of large-sized chloroaluminate anions, but also increase contact area with electrolyte and provide more exposed active sites, thereby exhibiting superior reversible rate capacity (86 mA h g−1 at 5.0 A g−1) and remarkable cycling performance (125 mA h g−1 after 1000 cycles at 2.0 A g−1).},

The FPs have been measured according to the Abel and Pensky-Martens closed-cup methods using 12 mL of sample and electric ignition. The SETs have been determined with the pure liquids, without any carrier substrates. A correlation of the FPs with the SETs, as well as with vapor pressures and boiling points is attempted. Furthermore, the effect of the addition of two non-flammable solvents [1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethyl-sulfonyl)imide and methyl nonafluorobutyl ether] and a flame-retardant additive (trimethyl phosphate) on both the SET and the FP of a carbonate-based electrolyte is discussed. As an alternative to their experimental determination, the FPs of the pure solvents have been calculated from other physical and chemical properties of the substance, and the FPs of the solvent mixtures and electrolytes from the FPs of their flammable constituents. Some of the models predict the FPs with an accuracy of ± 10°C, which may be sufficient to estimate the flammability hazards for many applications.},

	abstract = {Due to the tremendous importance of electrochemical energy storage, numerous new materials and electrode architectures for batteries and supercapacitors have emerged in recent years. Correctly characterizing these systems requires considerable time, effort, and experience to ensure proper metrics are reported. Many new nanomaterials show electrochemical behavior somewhere in between conventional double-layer capacitor and battery electrode materials, making their characterization a non-straightforward task. It is understandable that some researchers may be misinformed about how to rigorously characterize their materials and devices, which can result in inflation of their reported data. This is not uncommon considering the current state of the field nearly requires record breaking performance for publication in high-impact journals. Incorrect characterization and data reporting misleads both the materials and device development communities, and it is the shared responsibility of the community to follow rigorous reporting methodologies to ensure published results are reliable to ensure constructive progress. This tutorial aims to clarify the main causes of inaccurate data reporting and to give examples of how researchers should proceed. The best practices for measuring and reporting metrics such as capacitance, capacity, coulombic and energy efficiencies, electrochemical impedance, and the energy and power densities of capacitive and pseudocapacitive materials are discussed.},

However, many problems exist in the electrolyte system of aluminum ion battery, such as high price, low capacity. We prepare a novel AlCl 3 /Benzyltriethylammonium chloride electrolyte for aluminum ion battery. The battery displays a good performance at high current densities: 102 mA h g -1 at 5 A g -1 with a coulombic efficiency of 98\% and 91 mA h g -1 at 10 A g -1 after 1500 cycles. It only takes 13 seconds to be fully charged/discharged at the current density of 25 A g -1 . The mechanism of intercalation/de-intercalation of chloroaluminate anions is confirmed by characterization and we believe AlCl 3 /Benzyltriethylammonium chloride will be a promising electrolyte for aluminum ion batteries.},

Decomposition of electrolyte in the surface region of CB in Li-ion cells at high voltages up to 4.9 V is here studied using electrochemical measurements as well as structural and surface characterizations. LiPF6 and LiClO4 dissolved in ethylene carbonate:diethylene carbonate (1:1) were used as the electrolyte to study irreversible charge capacity of CB cathodes when cycled between 4.9 V and 2.5 V. Synchrotron-based soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SOXPES) results revealed spontaneous partial decomposition of the electrolytes on the CB electrode, without applying external current or voltage. Depth profile analysis of the electrolyte/cathode interphase indicated that the concentration of decomposed species is highest at the outermost surface of the CB. It is concluded that carboxylate and carbonate bonds (originating from solvent decomposition) and LiF (when LiPF6 was used) take part in the formation of the decomposed species. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements and transmission electron microscopy results, however, did not show formation of a dense surface layer on CB particles.},

This is supported with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements and associated core-level shift DFT calculations. We compare the oxygen 1s spectra from oxygen impurities in C60 and C59N, and calculate a range of possible oxidized and hydroxylated structures and associated formation barriers. These results allow us to propose a model for the oxygen present in these samples, notably the importance of water surface adsorption and possible ice formation.

In this work, sol-gel process has been utilised to manufacture durable low density hemp based composites. Morphological characterisation by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that hemp shiv was embedded well in the matrix. Detailed chemical analysis using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) indicate the presence of water soluble and ethanol soluble extractives leached from the hemp shiv which are incorporated into the silica matrix inducing the binding effect.

Material characterization reveals similar porosity, electrolyte-accessible surface area, element composition, and graphitic crystallinity between N-RGO and RGO except the difference in the nitrogen content. In 1 M H2SO4, additional pseudocapacitance provided by pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N/pyridone-N is clearly observed at the potential negative to 0.6 V (vs. RHE) while this contribution in pseudocapacitance diminishes in 1 M KOH due to the lack of proton in the electrolyte for these basic functional groups to undergo redox reactions. The double-layer capacitance of N-RGO in 1 M H2SO4 in higher than that in 1 M KOH owing to the presence of N-containing functional groups which increase the electronic charge density of graphene and favor proton adsorption in the acidic electrolyte. The contribution of nitrogen-containing functional groups on CS,T in acidic media is more pronounced than that in the alkaline electrolyte.

While we were trying to understand the improved capacitance using scanning photoemission microscopy with a capability of probing local nitrogen–carbon bonding configurations within a single sheet of graphene, we observed interesting microscopic features of N-configurations: N-doped sites even at basal planes, distinctive distributions of N-configurations between edges and basal planes, and their distinctive evolutions with plasma duration. The local N-configuration mappings during plasma treatment, alongside binding energy calculated by density functional theory, revealed that the origin of the improved capacitance is a certain N-configuration at basal planes.},

During discharge, a nanometer-thin ({\textless} 5 nm) layer of Li2O2 forms homogeneously throughout the electrode before it is passivated at a final specific charge of ∼365 mAh/g. Higher discharge charge rates lead to thinner and more densely packed layers of Li2O2. Electrolyte decomposition also occurs in parallel, as evidenced by the continuous increase of LiF and sulfur containing species of the degraded LiTFSI salt. On charge, O2 evolves initially according to a 2e−/O2 rate, but as the cell over-potentials increase, O2 evolution rate approaches 4e−/O2, thus demonstrating a significant extent of parasitic side-reactions. Unlike the discharge, the charge leads to inhomogeneous electrode reactions causing a continuous removal of Li2O2 with no indication of LiO2 or Li2O intermediates. The decomposition side-products formed during discharge are also removed and the spectra of the pristine electrode are nearly retained at a full charge. Our results show that the analysis of Li-O2 battery chemistry requires broad approach based on the combination of various electrode surface sensitive techniques, such as XPS and OEMS, in order to provide further fundamental understanding of the mechanisms behind the complex electrochemistry involving the Li and O2 as well as several other predominant degradation products of the electrode and electrolyte.},

All these techniques yield information on the graphitic character of the surface.

For low surface area conductive blacks, the electrical conductivity correlates well with the surface chemistry. In the case of the XPS and SIMS data, this correlation is also valid when other types of carbon blacks such as thermal and furnace blacks are included, confirming the determining influence of the carbon black surface chemistry on the electrical conductivity.},

The relative intensities and the energy positions for the core-level satellites have been determined. For C60, a comparison of the low energy π type shake-up satellites gives good agreement between theory and experiment. Also, the energies of these features for fullerene and glassy carbon are very similar, whereas the corresponding energies for HOPG are somewhat larger, presumably, because of the higher density of the latter. Moreover, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) study indicates that the C60 samples consist of a thick layer of large clusters on the Si(111) surface, which is in line with the molecular character of the XPS spectrum. Furthermore, the broad high energy satellite does not consist of a single plasmon but of many components due to collective excitations characteristic of molecules and solids.

Hydrophilic surface of oxidized nanotube material has lower affinity to C60 molecules and provides for concentration of C60 molecules into clusters, which show differential charging effect in XPS spectra. The differential charging effect disappears after laser processing, which induces photopolymerization of fullerene clusters. The as-synthesized nanotubes form composites with more evenly distributed fullerene.},

However, the widespread application of most batteries hitherto developed is hindered by their high cost. Here, an intermediate temperature molten salt battery is developed that emphatically resolves this issue by using all earth-abundant and cheap elements. Operated at 170°C, the cell comprises of a Fe metal anode, NaCl saturated NaAlCl4 electrolyte and an AlCl4- intercalated graphite cathode in the fully charged state. It has a capacity retention of 85\% after nearly 10,000 cycles. After characterizing the anode, it was determined that the high reversibility of the Fe to FeCl2 solid state transformation are responsible for the absence of dendritic growth on such a metal anode. Different electrode capacity matching strategies are discussed in the context of ensuring safe operation during overcharging. Finally, the overall material cost of the Fe/Graphite cell is estimated to be 33.9 \$ kWh-1, which can potentially meet the demands of the commercial energy storage market.},

Herein, a special crystal carbon@graphene microsphere (CCGM) composite was successfully synthesized. The scalable carbonaceous microsphere composite displays a small specific surface area and a superior structure stability. As a potassium ion battery electrode in a half-cell, CCGM delivers an initial capacity of 297.89 mAh g–1 with a high Coulombic efficiency of about 99\%. It achieves an excellent cyclic stability with no capacity loss after 1250 cycles at the low current density of 100 mA g–1 with a long performing period of more than one year. As the cathode for an aluminum battery, a reversible specific capacity of 99.1 mAh g–1 at 1000 mA g–1 is obtained. CCGM delivers a long cycle performance of about 10 000 cycles at 4000 mA g–1 with a capacity retention of nearly 100\%.

Nevertheless, the scarcity of suitable cathode materials with satisfactory rate performance and cycling stability hinders its further development and wider field of application. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for designing a novel two-dimensionally porous Co9S8 nanosheets as the cathode materials for AIBs. The electrode exhibits an outstanding electrochemical performance with an excellent cycling stability (maintains 120 mAh g−1 after 250 cycles at 0.2 A g−1) and enchanced rate performance (60 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1 and can quickly recover to 120 mAh g−1 when the current density is reduced back to 0.1 A g−1). Furthermore, high capacity retentions and superior stability for the assembled soft-pack batteries can also be achieved under high and low temperatures and stringent bending conditions. The remarkable aluminum storage behavior of the engineered Co9S8 cathode is attributed to its unique two dimensional (2D) geometrical architecture, abundant internal porosity and nanosized secondary building blocks. Our findings appear to provide a potential new avenue in the design of cathode materials in AIBs.},

Among all the proposed non-lithium-based battery systems, rechargeable aluminum-ion batteries (RAIBs) are considered as a promising candidate due to aluminum’s abundance and safety. Naturally, exploring compatible and high-performance cathode materials for RAIBs becomes a key issue for pushing RAIBs from lab-level to industrialization. In this work, we report a novel high-performance RAIB system using MOF-derived Co3O4@MWCNTs polyhedron composite as cathode. The well-defined morphology of MOF-derived Co3O4 and enhancement brought by MWCNTs allow Co3O4@MWCNTs polyhedrons to deliver an initial discharge capacity of ca. 266.3 mAh g-1, and the reversible specific capacity can reach to 125 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 over 150 cycles. The energy storage mechanism has been verified to be a reversible valence-change reaction between Co3O4 and Co. These findings can enlighten future researches regrading to MOF derivatives as advanced cathode materials for RAIBs.},

Specifically, EMC forms a thinner layer of cathode electrolyte interface on the graphite surface with fewer Li-F and ROCO2Li species than that with dimethyl carbonate and diethyl carbonate. EMC electrolyte reduces charge-transfer resistance, polarization and self-discharge of graphite electrodes. It also enhances Coulombic efficiency, cycle and rate performances, allowing 90\% of the capacity to be available from graphite even at 12 C (1200 mA g-1).

	abstract = {The expansion of renewable energy and the growing number of electric vehicles and mobile devices are demanding improved and low-cost electrochemical energy storage. In order to meet the future needs for energy storage, novel material systems with high energy densities, readily available raw materials, and safety are required. Currently, lithium and lead mainly dominate the battery market, but apart from cobalt and phosphorous, lithium may show substantial supply challenges prospectively, as well. Therefore, the search for new chemistries will become increasingly important in the future, to diversify battery technologies. But which materials seem promising? Using a selection algorithm for the evaluation of suitable materials, the concept of a rechargeable, high-valent all-solid-state aluminum-ion battery appears promising, in which metallic aluminum is used as the negative electrode. On the one hand, this offers the advantage of a volumetric capacity four times higher (theoretically) compared to lithium analog. On the other hand, aluminum is the most abundant metal in the earth's crust. There is a mature industry and recycling infrastructure, making aluminum very cost efficient. This would make the aluminum-ion battery an important contribution to the energy transition process, which has already started globally. So far, it has not been possible to exploit this technological potential, as suitable positive electrodes and electrolyte materials are still lacking. The discovery of inorganic materials with high aluminum-ion mobility—usable as solid electrolytes or intercalation electrodes—is an innovative and required leap forward in the field of rechargeable high-valent ion batteries. In this review article, the constraints for a sustainable and seminal battery chemistry are described, and we present an assessment of the chemical elements in terms of negative electrodes, comprehensively motivate utilizing aluminum, categorize the aluminum battery field, critically review the existing positive electrodes and solid electrolytes, present a promising path for the accelerated development of novel materials and address problems of scientific communication in this field.},

	abstract = {Understanding the factors limiting Li+ charge transfer kinetics in Li-ion batteries is essential in improving the rate performance, especially at lower temperatures. The Li+ charge transfer process involved in the lithium intercalation of graphite anode includes the step of de-solvation of the solvated Li+ in the liquid electrolyte and the step of transport of Li+ in the preformed solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on electrodes until the Li+ accepts an electron at the electrode and becomes a Li in the electrode. Whether the de-solvation process or the Li+ transport through the SEI is a limiting step depends on the nature of the interphases at the electrode and electrolyte interfaces. Several examples involving the electrode materials such as graphite, lithium titanate (LTO), lithium iron phosphate (LFP), lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA) and solid Li+ conductor such as lithium lanthanum titanate or Li-Al-Ti-phosphate are reviewed and discussed to clarify the conditions at which either the de-solvation or the transport of Li+ in SEI is dominating and how the electrolyte components affect the activation energy of Li+ charge transfer kinetics. How the electrolyte additives impact the Li+ charge transfer kinetics at both the anode and the cathode has been examined at the same time in 3-electrode full cells. The resulting impact on Li+ charge transfer resistance, Rct, and activation energy, Ea, at both electrodes are reported and discussed.},

Herein, an aluminum-selenium (Al-Se) battery that operates at room temperature with high energy efficiency is reported. This Al-Se battery exhibits high selenium utilization with a discharge capacity of 607 mAh g−1, a reduced overpotential, and high volumetric capacity for over 100 cycles. Furthermore, ex-situ spectroscopic and microscopic investigations of the Se cathodes indicated the existence of an aluminum selenide component as the discharge product. Additionally, in-situ transmission electron microscopy provided not only insights into understanding the Al-Se electrochemistry, but also a real-time characterization technique to evaluate the electrochemistry of AIBs in general.},

	abstract = {We present a wide range of testing results on an excellent moderate-energy-density lithium-ion pouch cell chemistry to serve as benchmarks for academics and companies developing advanced lithium-ion and other “beyond lithium-ion” cell chemistries to (hopefully) exceed. These results are far superior to those that have been used by researchers modelling cell failure mechanisms and as such, these results are more representative of modern Li-ion cells and should be adopted by modellers. Up to three years of testing has been completed for some of the tests. Tests include long-term charge-discharge cycling at 20, 40 and 55°C, long-term storage at 20, 40 and 55°C, and high precision coulometry at 40°C. Several different electrolytes are considered in this LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2/graphite chemistry, including those that can promote fast charging. The reasons for cell performance degradation and impedance growth are examined using several methods. We conclude that cells of this type should be able to power an electric vehicle for over 1.6 million kilometers (1 million miles) and last at least two decades in grid energy storage. The authors acknowledge that other cell format-dependent loss, if any, (e.g. cylindrical vs. pouch) may not be captured in these experiments.},

	abstract = {Monolithic realization of metallic 1T and semiconducting 2H phases makes MoS2 a potential candidate for future microelectronic circuits. A method for engineering a stable 1T phase from the 2H phase in a scalable manner and an in-depth electrical characterization of the 1T phase is wanting at large. Here we demonstrate a controllable and scalable 2H to 1T phase engineering technique for MoS2 using microwave plasma. Our method allows lithographically defining 1T regions on a 2H sample. The 1T samples show excellent temporal and thermal stability making it suitable for standard device fabrication techniques. We conduct both two-probe and four-probe electrical transport measurements on devices with back-gated field effect transistor geometry in a temperature range of 4 K to 300 K. The 1T samples exhibit Ohmic current-voltage characteristics in all temperature ranges without any dependence to the gate voltage, a signature of a metallic state. The sheet resistance of our 1T MoS2 sample is considerably lower and the carrier concentration is a few orders of magnitude higher than that of the 2H samples. In addition, our samples show negligible temperature dependence of resistance from 4 K to 300 K ruling out any hoping mediated or activated electrical transport.},

	abstract = {Chemically and mechanically exfoliated MoS2 single-layer samples have substantially different properties. While mechanically exfoliated single-layers are monophase(1H polytype with Mo in trigonal prismatic coordination), the chemically exfoliated samples show coexistence of three different phases, 1H, 1T (Mo in octahedral coordination), and 1T′ (a distorted 2×1 1T superstructure). By using first-principles calculations, we investigate the energetics and the dynamical stability of the three phases. We show that the 1H phase is the most stable one, while the metallic 1T phase, strongly unstable, undergoes a phase transition towards a metastable and insulating 1T′ structure composed of separated zigzag chains. We calculate electronic structure, phonon dispersion, Raman frequencies, and intensities for the 1T′ structure. We provide a microscopical description of the J1, J2, and J3 Raman features that were first detected more than 20 years ago but have remained unexplained up to now. Finally, we show that H adsorbates, which are naturally present at the end of the chemical exfoliation process, stabilize the 1T′ over the 1H one.},

Li2SO4 (pH = 6.5) allows 99\% efficiency to be exhibited at 1.6 V cell potential with low self-discharge, while in BeSO4 (pH = 2.1) efficiency is low (81\%). Li2SO4 performs better due to high di-hydrogen over-potential at the negative electrode and related pH increase in AC porosity. When stainless steel current collectors are used in Li2SO4, the cell resistance suddenly increases after 12 hours floating at 1.6 V, due to corrosion of the positive collector. With nickel negative and stainless steel positive collectors, the electrode potentials are shifted by −105 mV at cell potential of 1.6 V, allowing stable cell parameters (capacitance, resistance) and reduction of corrosion products formation on positive steel collector after 120 hours floating. Phenanthrenequinone was grafted on activated carbon to get an additional faradaic contribution in buffer solutions (pH = 4.0 or 7.2). The three-electrode cell CVs show that the redox peaks of the phenanthrenequinone graft shift toward negative values when pH increases from 4 to 7.2. The grafted carbon displays a capacitance value of 194 F g−1 at pH = 4.0 as compared to 82 F g−1 for the as-received carbon.},

A description is provided here of the common methods of self-discharge study: half cell vs. full cell measurements and open-circuit potential decay versus float currents. A description of some of the models used to evaluate faradaic self-discharge is presented, with a synopsis of the important aspects of the many available charge redistribution models. An overview of the current self-discharge mechanisms for various ECs is provided, highlighting that for many systems there are significant factors of the self-discharge process which remain unknown.

	abstract = {Electrical energy storage (EES) is one of the most critical areas of technological research around the world. Storing and efficiently using electricity generated by intermittent sources and the transition of our transportation fleet to electric drive depend fundamentally on the development of EES systems with high energy and power densities. Supercapacitors are promising devices for highly efficient energy storage and power management, yet they still suffer from moderate energy densities compared to batteries. To establish a detailed understanding of the science and technology of carbon/carbon supercapacitors, this review discusses the basic principles of the electrical double-layer (EDL), especially regarding the correlation between ion size/ion solvation and the pore size of porous carbon electrodes. We summarize the key aspects of various carbon materials synthesized for use in supercapacitors. With the objective of improving the energy density, the last two sections are dedicated to strategies to increase the capacitance by either introducing pseudocapacitive materials or by using novel electrolytes that allow to increasing the cell voltage. In particular, advances in ionic liquids, but also in the field of organic electrolytes, are discussed and electrode mass balancing is expanded because of its importance to create higher performance asymmetric electrochemical capacitors.},

Key chemicals are trace water, the solvent acetonitrile, and the salt tetraethyl ammonium tetrafluoroborate. The changes differ hugely between negative and positive pole; the positively polarized electrode is much more affected.

Contrary to conventional desolvation-based intercalation of potassium, we demonstrate excellent capacity retention of ∼80\% at rates up to 10 A g−1 (30 second charge), with 95\% capacity retention over 1000 cycles, and up to 100 mA h g−1 capacity. Raman and X-ray diffraction following 1000 cycles demonstrates no signature of defects, damage, or change to graphitic crystallinity compared to uncycled pristine materials that is attributed to weak ion–lattice interactions due to the solvated guest K ions. In situ Raman spectroscopy highlights the sequential formation of a stage 4, 3, 2, and 1 graphite intercalation compound (GIC) that occurs without the signature of dilute staging. In a charged stage 1 compound, we observe lattice expansion from 0.335 nm to 1.16 nm and measure the work function to be ∼3.4 eV. Overall, this system overcomes rate and durability bottlenecks that limit current K-ion battery electrodes, and gives promise to cointercalation for durable, fast, and low-cost storage systems.},

Hence there is a ‘driving force’, corresponding to the free energy of discharge, tending to spontaneously diminish the charge if some mechanism(s) of self-discharge exist. An ideally polarizable (chargeable) capacitor has no self-discharge or current-leakage pathway and hence can remain charged indefinitely. However, practical capacitors, like batteries, suffer appreciable self-discharge over periods of days or months so that this phenomenon is of major interest in evaluation of capacitor performance and choice of materials to minimize self-discharge. Several mechanisms of self-discharge are distinguished and the resulting forms of the change of potential on open-circuit with time or log time provide a means of identifying the type of self-discharge process that occurs. With RuO2, some remarkable potential-recovery effects arise following discharge.},

	abstract = {Certain microporous carbons have pores of molecular dimensions, the size of which can be adjusted over a wide range to fit the dimensions of a large variety of molecules. With knowing the dimensions of these molecules, size-calibrated porous carbons can be produced. In this work, we took advantage of the electronic conductivity of carbon in using it as an electrode in electrolytic solutions. By changing the electrode potential, we could induce electroadsorption and electrodesorption of ions of different dimensions into pore-calibrated carbons, thus enabling us to estimate effective ion sizes. A few fundamental questions such as whether ions accommodated in the electrodes' pores are in a solvated state, which is important for novel electrochemical energy storage devices and for microbiological systems, could be addressed. Analysis of the results indicates that all the cations that are employed are electroadsorbed in the electrode pores in hydrated states. Compared with the monovalent cations, the bivalent cations exhibit dimensions that make them almost twice as big. Monovalent anions are basically adsorbed in a nonhydrated state. The doubly charged sulfate anion is adsorbed in the hydrated state. The nitrate, a multiatom planar anion, has a smaller effective dimension than the monoatomic halogen anions, in accordance with the observation that the pores in many activated carbons are slit-shaped. The analysis of the results enabled us to establish a scale of ionic effective dimensions in aqueous media, as presented below (MTBE stands for methyl tert-butyl ether):  cations, [3.62 Å, N2] {\textless} Cs+ {\textless} K+ {\textless} Na+ {\textless} Li+ {\textless} [4.21 Å, CF4] {\textless} [5.05 Å, SF6] {\textless} [5.8 Å, MTBE] {\textless} Ba2+, Ca2+, and Mg2+; anions, [3.62 Å, N2] {\textless} NO3- {\textless} Cl- {\textless} F- {\textless} Br- {\textless} [4.21 Å, CF4] {\textless} ClO4- {\textless} [5.05 Å, SF6] {\textless} [5.8 Å, MTBE] {\textless} SO2-.

They formed 3D interconnected network of spheres having higher surface area, SA, ∼ 791 m2g−1 with electron rich surface environment. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed in 1 M HCl electrolyte for different scan rates. The estimated value of the CSP was 540 Fg−1 at 10 mVs−1 with cyclic stability maintained ∼ 97\% at 1000 cycles. The Galvanostatic charge-discharge (CD) measurements, carried out at 1 Ag−1, indicated the value of CSP ∼ 551 Fg−1 with energy, ED, and power density, PD, 20 Whkg−1 and 250 Wkg−1, respectively. The process of fabricating active electrode material was simple, environmentally compatible, time and cost effective to achieve effective electrochemical parameters. The double layer charge storage mechanism and nearly no presence of any redox reaction, made CNS suitable candidate for rechargeable supercapacitor application. Details are presented.},

	abstract = {In this paper an adaptive energy management strategy (EMS) based on fuzzy logic and the optimal sizing for a tramway with a hybrid energy storage system (ESS) combining batteries (BT) and supercapacitors (SC) are presented. The EMS applies a sliding window to estimate the forward energy consumption and adapt the instantaneous power target for BT and SC. The hybrid ESS sizing is obtained by an optimization with multi-objective genetic algorithms (GA). The fitness functions are expressed in economic terms, and correspond to the costs of the energy absorbed from the catenary as well as the operation cost of the hybrid ESS (investment and cycling cost). The selected case study is the tramway of Seville, which operates in zones with and without catenary. The aim is to minimize the daily operating cost of the tramway taking into account the BT and SC degradation approach (cycling) and fulfilling the performance of the tramway in the catenary-less zone. The proposed approach (adaptive EMS and optimal sizing) is compared with the current solution in the tramway (SC-based) and with a hybrid ESS managed by a rule-based EMS (RB-EMS) in terms of daily operating cost and energy harnessing during regenerative braking phase. The proposed approach show cost reductions up to 25.5\% (from SC-based), 6.2\% (from hybrid ESS with RB-EMS) and a global efficiency around 84.4\%.},

This is due to their relatively short mass and charge pathways, high transport rates of both lithium ions and electrons, and other extremely charming surface activities. In this review paper, the effect of the nanostructure on the electrochemical performance of these anodes is presented.

In this work, a systematic study of a large set of devices is used to investigate the effect of process variability and operating voltage on the performance and stability of screen printed aqueous supercapacitors. The current collectors and active layers are printed with graphite and activated carbon inks, respectively, and aqueous NaCl used as the electrolyte. The devices are characterized through galvanostatic discharge measurements for quantitative determination of capacitance and equivalent series resistance (ESR), as well as impedance spectroscopy for a detailed study of the factors contributing to ESR. The capacitances are 200–360 mF and the ESRs 7.9–12.7 Ω, depending on the layer thicknesses. The ESR is found to be dominated by the resistance of the graphite current collectors and is compatible with applications in low-power distributed electronics. The effects of different operating voltages on the capacitance, leakage and aging rate of the supercapacitors are tested, and 1.0 V found to be the optimal choice for using the devices in energy harvesting applications.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous voltage drop between EDLC electrodes, when it is kept under the open-circuit condition, is commonly called ‘self-discharge’ and is interpreted as a result of energy loss by the device. Three mechanisms of self-discharge were proposed: due to a leakage-current, faradaic reactions and charge redistribution. According to the law of energy preservation, if the voltage drop is associated with the energy loss, the energy would more likely be exchanged with the environment. While heat generation was measured during EDLC charging and discharging, the corresponding effect during storage under open-circuit conditions has not been reported. This may support the conclusion that voltage changes during ‘self-discharge’ are not related to a considerable energy loss. Moreover, it has been shown that a two-stage charging process, i.e. first galvanostatic charging followed by a potentiostatic charge redistribution, resulted in considerably slower potential changes when the device was switched to the open circuit. All discussed models were based on the assumption that the energy accumulated by EDLCs is proportional to the voltage in the second power, with capacitance (C/2) as the proportionality constant. However, it has been shown that during EDLC charging or discharging through a resistance R, equations valid for ‘dielectric’ and electrolytic capacitors, do not hold in the case of EDLCs. Consequently, the assumption that the energetic state of the EDLC is proportional at any time to the voltage in the second power may not be valid due to considerable variability of the ‘constant’ C. Therefore, voltage changes may not reflect the energetic state of the device.},

	abstract = {Carbon materials, owing to their excellent electrical conductivity, tailorability, inexpensiveness and versatility, have been extensively studied as electrode materials for supercapacitors. The capacitance of carbon-based supercapacitor electrodes has remained at a mediocre level between 100 and 200 F g−1 for decades. Until recently, a new family of carbon materials termed hierarchical porous carbons has pushed the capacitance to new benchmark values beyond 300 F g−1, and has revitalized the exploration of carbon materials for supercapacitors. Hierarchical porous carbons contain different scales of pores (from micropores to macropores) inter-connected together and assembled in hierarchical patterns. Experimental studies coupled with theoretical investigations have elucidated that the presence of micropores is responsible for offering a large surface area to enhance charge storage capability, whilst mesopores, macropores and the hierarchical structure improve electrolyte infiltration and facilitate ion diffusion. This review will start by introducing different pore types and the definition of hierarchical porous structures, followed by discussion and exemplification of major synthesis strategies. In addition, recent molecular-level understanding of the relationship between pore size, functionalities inside pores, pore spatial distribution and capacitive performance is presented. Finally, challenges and future opportunities associated with hierarchical porous carbons for supercapacitors are discussed.},

High surface areas are achieved in hydrous RuO2 precipitates and in mixed ruthenium oxide−titanium oxide, (Ru−Ti)Ox, aerogels (in which nanoscale domains are networked to form a highly porous structure). The electrochemical properties of (Ru−Ti)Ox aerogels, RuO2, and hydrous RuO2 are examined by direct pressing of sub-milligram quantities of the solid onto the surface of a conductive carbon/wax composite. Voltammetric measurements in acidic electrolyte confirm a pseudocapacitive response for all the RuOx-based materials. Despite an improvement in BET surface area, as compared with other RuO2 materials, the (Ru−Ti)Ox aerogel displays a low specific capacitance, which correlates to the high degree of crystallinity of the aerogel. Nanocrystallites of rutile RuO2, formed during thermal treatment of the sol−gel Ru/Ti precursors, deleteriously affect the specific capacitance of the material; however, all RuOx domains in the aerogel are voltammetrically addressable. The influence of proton-donating species on the observed capacitance for the (Ru−Ti)Ox aerogel is evident from the dependence of the voltammetric charge in acidic electrolyte on the potential scan rate.},

In particular, with large surface area, high porosity, low density, good directionality, and tunable composition, electrospun nanofibers and mats are regarded as ideal candidates for various kinds of electrochemical energy storage devices such as supercapacitors (SCs). In this review, the recent progress in electrospun electrode materials for SCs is presented, covering the architecture design and their electrochemical performance. After a brief introduction about SCs, the basic principles of the electrospinning technique are discussed. Following, attention is paid to the discussion of various electrospun nanofibers and mats including 1D carbons, metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal nitrides, conducting polymers and composite nanomaterials with various types of architectures as electrodes for SCs. The relationship between the composition, architecture, and the electrochemical performance is discussed in detail. Finally, some challenges and perspectives of future research of the electrospun nanofibers and mats for high performance SCs are highlighted. It is anticipated that this review would provide the researchers some inspiration for constructing new types of energy storage devices.},

The paper prepared from the CNFs with an average diameter of 20 nm (LPI-CNF(20) paper) was firm and flexible even though it was prepared without using any binders. LPI-CNF(20) paper also had a high surface area and showed a high electrical conductivity and a moderate gas permeability according to its void size. These properties are required for cathodes in the latest battery systems such as lithium–air batteries. In electrochemical experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of LPI-CNF(20) paper as a cathode, the paper showed a larger discharge capacity on the basis of the cathode weight than a conventional cathode (a commercially available carbon paper combined with a porous carbon), which indicated that it has a high potential to be used as a cathode in lithium–air batteries.},

	abstract = {Problems, which may arise when low-temperature nitrogen adsorption is used for the characterisation of porous materials, are discussed in this review. Continuous or discontinuous manometric techniques can be employed for nitrogen adsorption measurements at 77 K. For pore structure analysis, the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms should be determined over the widest possible range of relative pressure, while allowing for slow equilibration and other operational problems, particularly at very low pressures. In spite of its artificial nature, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method is still used for the determination of surface area. In principle, nitrogen isotherms of Types II and IV are amenable to BET analysis provided that pores of molecular dimensions are absent and that the BET plot is obtained over an appropriate range of the isotherm. An empirical method based on the application of standard adsorption data is useful for checking the validity of the BET-area. All the computational procedures for pore size analysis have limitations of one sort or another. The various assumptions include an ideal pore shape, rigidity of the structure and an oversimplified model (capillary condensation or micropore filling). The derived pore widths and pore volumes should be regarded as effective (or apparent) values with respect to the adsorption of nitrogen at 77 K.},

The real part of the impedance at a given frequency is called ESR (equivalent series resistance). Several contributions are included in the ESR: the electrolyte resistance (including the separator), the active material resistance (with both ionic and electronic parts) and the active material/current collector interface resistance. The first two contributions have been intensively described and studied by many authors. The first part of this paper is focused on the use of surface treatments as a way to decrease the active material/current collector impedance. Al current collector foils have been treated following a two-step procedure: electrochemical etching and sol-gel coating by a highly-covering, conducting carbonaceous material. It aims to increase the Al foil/active material surface contact leading to lower resistance. In a second part, carbon-carbon supercapacitor impedance is discussed in term of complex capacitance and complex power from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data. This representation permits extraction of a relaxation time constant that provides important information on supercapacitor behaviour. The influence of carbon nanotubes addition on electrochemical performance of carbon/carbon supercapacitors has also been studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.},

	abstract = {The charge storage mechanism in MnO2 electrode, used in aqueous electrolyte, was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Thin MnO2 films deposited on a platinum substrate and thick MnO2 composite electrodes were used. First, the cyclic voltammetry data established that only a thin layer of MnO2 is involved in the redox process and electrochemically active. Second, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data revealed that the manganese oxidation state was varying from III to IV for the reduced and oxidized forms of thin film electrodes, respectively, during the charge/discharge process. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data also show that Na+ cations from the electrolyte were involved in the charge storage process of MnO2 thin film electrodes. However, the Na/Mn ratio for the reduced electrode was much lower than what was anticipated for charge compensation dominated by Na+, thus suggesting the involvement of protons in the pseudofaradaic mechanism. An important finding of this work is that, unlike thin film electrodes, no change of the manganese oxidation state was detected for a thicker composite electrode because only a very thin layer is involved in the charge storage process.},

The electrochemical performances of equal/unequal mass configurations are examined in terms of potential stability window and the durability of the electrochemical capacitor. The unequal mass configuration of carbon fibres electrodes shows 25\% higher gravimetric energy density than unequal commercial YP-50 electrodes. Besides, unequal mass configuration of carbon fibres exhibit 41\% higher gravimetric energy density as compared with commercial YP-50 carbon at 2.7 V as extensively reported in the literature.

	abstract = {The lithium storage properties of graphene nanosheet (GNS) materials as high capacity anode materials for rechargeable lithium secondary batteries (LIB) were investigated. Graphite is a practical anode material used for LIB, because of its capability for reversible lithium ion intercalation in the layered crystals, and the structural similarities of GNS to graphite may provide another type of intercalation anode compound. While the accommodation of lithium in these layered compounds is influenced by the layer spacing between the graphene nanosheets, control of the intergraphene sheet distance through interacting molecules such as carbon nanotubes (CNT) or fullerenes (C60) might be crucial for enhancement of the storage capacity. The specific capacity of GNS was found to be 540 mAh/g, which is much larger than that of graphite, and this was increased up to 730 mAh/g and 784 mAh/g, respectively, by the incorporation of macromolecules of CNT and C60 to the GNS.},

The approaches used for performance improvement are summarized, and the causes of first-cycle irreversible capacity loss are discussed. The capacity retentions and irreversible capacity losses of various alloy anodes are compared. Several alloy anodes exhibited excellent cycle life (up to 300 cycles) with high initial coulombic efficiency (80–90\%) and large reversible capacity (500–700mAhg−1).},

The electrolytes are classified into several categories, including: aqueous, organic, ionic liquids, solid-state or quasi-solid-state, as well as redox-active electrolytes. Effects of electrolyte properties on ES performance are discussed in detail. The principles and methods of designing and optimizing electrolytes for ES performance and application are highlighted through a comprehensive analysis of the literature. Interaction among the electrolytes, electro-active materials and inactive components (current collectors, binders, and separators) is discussed. The challenges in producing high-performing electrolytes are analyzed. Several possible research directions to overcome these challenges are proposed for future efforts, with the main aim of improving ESs' energy density without sacrificing existing advantages (e.g., a high power density and a long cycle-life) (507 references).},

Nanomaterials are ideal candidates as electrode materials in different fields of energy storage devices, offering favorable transport features, high surface to volume ratio and excellent physicochemical properties. This review is focused on the recent progress in nanostructured Sn-based electrode materials, including Sn, Sn alloys, Sn oxides (SnOx, x = 1, 2), dichalcogenides (SnSx, x = 1, 2) and oxysalts for lithium/sodium-ion batteries and supercapacitors.

They are very attractive candidates for efficient electrochemical energy storage systems because of their unique physicochemical properties, such as conductivity, mechanical and thermal stability, and cyclability. In this review, we aim to provide a systematic summary of the synthesis, modification, and electrochemical performance of nanostructured Sn-based compounds, as well as their energy storage applications in lithium/sodium-ion batteries (LIB/SIB), and supercapacitors. The relationship between nanoarchitectures and electrochemical performances, as well as the related charge-storage mechanism is discussed.

This work presents a sodium-ion anode based on a BP−carbon nanocomposite synthesized from commercial red phosphorus and low-cost super P carbon black. Intimate interactions between BP and carbon are present, which helps to maintain the electrical conduction during cycling and, therefore, a high cycling stability is achieved. It exhibits a high capacity retention of 1381 mAh g−1 for sodium-ion storage after 100 cycles, maintaining 90.5 \% of the initial reversible capacity.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) calculations within the first-principles methodology are performed on the generated amorphous carbon nitride systems. Depending on the carbon bonding configuration, the carbon 1s energies are found to vary from 283 to 288 eV while those of nitrogen are found to range from 397 to 405 eV. Additional calculations on model crystalline systems like nitrogen substituted graphite (nitrogen in trigonal structure) and nitrogen substituted diamond support the finding that the C and N 1s energies are not only sensitive to the coordination number of the atom but also to the interatomic distances. Our calculations based on computer generated structures are a viable alternative for the analysis of XPS spectra and support the interpretation of the N 1s energy at 398.4 eV to correspond to two-coordinated N with at least one sp2 C nearest neighbor.},

Herein, a flexible aqueous Al-ion battery is successfully fabricated for the first time with copper hexacyanoferrate cathode and polypyrrole (PPy) coated MoO3 anode sandwiched by gel electrolyte. The as-assembled Al-ion battery based on intercalation chemistry exhibits an excellent cycling stability of 83.2\% capacity retention after 100 cycles and good rate capability benefiting from the conductive PPy coating layer on MoO3 anode. Besides, the battery demonstrates impressive flexibility and safety to sustain various deformations and mechanical abuse including bending, squeezing, folding, twisting as well as arbitrary drilling and tailoring into any desired shapes.

	abstract = {Adjusting the hydrogen-binding free energy (ΔGH*) of two dimensional (2D) MoS2 by changing the interlayer distance has been an effective strategy to improve the intrinsic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a facile solvothermal access via various ratio of N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF)/H2O has been used to modulate interlayer distance of nanostructured MoS2. With increasing of DMF, the interlayer distance of MoS2 can be expanded to 9.4Å with smaller sizes, which may be derived from intercalation effect of DMF. The certain ratio of DMF/H2O (volume ratio of 19/1, MoS2-D19H1) leads to the largest interlayer distances of 10.0Å and the smallest size of nanospheres with less stacking than counterparts synthesized at other ratios of DMF/H2O. The expanded interlayer distance of MoS2-D19H1 may change electronic structure of active sites for HER, implying the improved ΔGH* and the intrinsic activity of MoS2. The smallest size also suggests the more exposure of active sites for HER. The electrochemical measurements demonstrate that MoS2-D19H1 shows the best electrocatalytic performances than MoS2 samples synthesized at other ratio of DMF/H2O. This work may provide a promising strategy to tune the interlayer distance of 2D-layered transition metal dichalcogenide for efficient HER.},

Surface composition determined using quantitative X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) showed that the surfaces of the as received fibers and the water washed fibers were predominantly lignin and extractives and only after NaOH treatments was there sufficient oxygen on the surface to allow for the presence of polysaccharides. Using the in-lens backscattered SEM technique, spatial distribution of polymeric materials on the surface was shown to be highly non-uniform. The findings have implications for design of natural fiber composites and the interfacial properties between fiber and matrix. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2016, 133, 43023.},

This is due to several challenging issues related to a massive volume expansion during operation. Nanostructured electrodes can accommodate the volume expansion but typically suffer from cumbersome synthesis routes and associated problems regarding scalability and cost efficiency, preventing their commercialization. Herein, a facile, easily scalable, and highly cost-efficient fabrication route is proposed based on electroplating and subsequent electrolytic oxidation of tin, resulting in additive-free tin oxide anodes for lithium-ion batteries. The electrodes prepared accordingly exhibit excellent performance in terms of gravimetric and volumetric capacity as well as promising cycle life and rate capability, making them suitable for future high-energy lithium-ion batteries.},

However, there has not yet been a comprehensive study on its structure and electrochemical properties for Li/Na ion uptake, though it is important to characterize its contribution in any study of active materials that uses this additive in non-negligible amounts. In this article the structure of SPCB has been characterized and a comprehensive study on the electrochemical Li/Na ion uptake capability and reaction mechanisms are reported. SPCB exhibits a considerable lithiation capacity (up to 310 mAh g–1) from the Li ion intercalation in the graphite structure. Sodiation in SPCB undergoes two stages: Na ion intercalation into the layers between the graphene sheets and the Na plating in the pores between the nano-graphitic domains, and a sodiation capacity up to 145 mAh g–1 has been achieved. Moreover, the influence of the type and content of binders on the lithiation and sodiation properties has been investigated. The cycling stability is much enhanced with sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC) binder in the electrode and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) in the electrolyte; and a higher content of binder improves the Coulombic efficiency during dis-/charge.},

Anodic dissolution of cheap materials commonly used as cathode current collectors is a great challenge. At laboratory scale, this issue is solved by using expensive/scarce current collectors. The aim of our work is twofold. 1) To quantify the impact of the current collector in the battery cost by performing a cost analysis, which reveals that the current collector is currently the most expensive element in AIBs. 2) To propose the use of carbon-based current collectors, such as gas diffusion layers (GDLs), which are shown to be an excellent option for AIBs. From an electrochemical perspective, the GDL does not corrode and does not catalyze electrolyte decomposition. Moreover, performances of AIBs using GDLs as current collectors are comparable to those using more expensive state-of-the-art materials, while its use contributes to reducing battery costs.},

However, the various intermediate conversion and alloy reactions taking place during lithiation/delithiation, as well as the electrolyte stability, have not been fully elucidated, and many ambiguities remain. An amorphous SnO2 thin film was investigated for use as a model electrode by a combination of postmortem X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy supported by density functional theory calculations and scanning electron microscopy to shed light on these different processes. The early stages of lithiation reveal the presence of multiple overlapping reactions leading to the formation of Li2SnO3 and Sn0 phases between 2 and 0.8 V vs Li+/Li. Between 0.45 V and 5 mV vs Li+/Li Li8SnO6, Li2O and LixSn phases are formed. Electrolyte reduction occurs simultaneously in two steps, at 1.4 and 1 V vs Li+/Li, corresponding to the decomposition of the LiPF6 salt and ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate solvents, respectively. Most of the reactions during delithiation are reversible up to 1.5 V vs Li+/Li, with the reappearance of Sn0 accompanied by the decomposition of Li2O. Above 1.5 V vs Li+/Li, Sn0 is partially reoxidized to SnOx. This process tends to limit the conversion reactions in favor of the alloy reaction, as also confirmed by the long-term cycling samples.},

Here, a thorough survey is provided of the synthesis of SnO2-based nanomaterials with various structures and chemical compositions, and their application as negative electrodes for LIBs. It covers SnO2 with different morphologies ranging from 1D nanorods/nanowires/nanotubes, to 2D nanosheets, to 3D hollow nanostructures. Nanocomposites consisting of SnO2 and different carbonaceous supports, e.g., amorphous carbon, carbon nanotubes, graphene, are also investigated. The use of Sn-based nanomaterials as the anode material for LIBs will be briefly discussed as well. The aim of this review is to provide an in-depth and rational understanding such that the electrochemical properties of SnO2-based anodes can be effectively enhanced by making proper nanostructures with optimized chemical composition. By focusing on SnO2, the hope is that such concepts and strategies can be extended to other potential metal oxides, such as titanium dioxide or iron oxides, thus shedding some light on the future development of high-performance metal-oxide based negative electrodes for LIBs.},

Analysis of the bonding between the metal atoms and the Sn systems shows that the interactions have significant ionicity—the electron charge reductions on the metal atoms are up to {\textasciitilde}0.87e. We predict that the diffusion of the metal atoms at the nanosheet surface is much faster than in bulk Sn, and, consequently, the bulk–nanosheet transition is expected to facilitate the migration of the metal atoms and might improve the charge/discharge rate of Sn anode materials. We also show that size reduction affects the energetics of subsurface layers. For instance, for both Li and Na, the lowest defect formation energies inside a 6-layer Sn(111) nanosheet are {\textasciitilde}0.24eV larger than those in the bulk Sn. The analysis of Li and Na insertion pathways and barriers into a 6-layer Sn(111) nanosheets shows that the insertion into Sn nanosheets is energetically and kinetically more favorable than insertion into Si systems.},

Upon charging, a reaction front propagated progressively along the nanowire, causing the nanowire to swell, elongate, and spiral. The reaction front is a “Medusa zone” containing a high density of mobile dislocations, which are continuously nucleated and absorbed at the moving front. This dislocation cloud indicates large in-plane misfit stresses and is a structural precursor to electrochemically driven solid-state amorphization. Because lithiation-induced volume expansion, plasticity, and pulverization of electrode materials are the major mechanical effects that plague the performance and lifetime of high-capacity anodes in lithium-ion batteries, our observations provide important mechanistic insight for the design of advanced batteries.

Electrochemical behavior is found to depend crucially on the structural parameters of the array. An array consisting of SnO2nanorods of average 60 nm in diameter and 670 nm in length delivers a reversible capacity of as high as 580 mAh g−1 after 100 cycles (at 0.1C) and shows excellent rate capability (350 mAh g−1 at the 5C rate). Structural disintegration and agglomeration were not observed for SnO2 arrays even after 50 cycles.},

The aliovalent ion doping may present an effective way to improve the electrochemical performances of MoO3. Here, it is shown, by first-principle calculations, that doping MoO3 with V by 12.5\% can modulate significantly electronic structure and provide a small diffusion barrier for enhancing the electrochemical performance of MoO3. The ultralong Mo0.88V0.12O2.94 nanostructures, which retain the h-MoO3 structure and present an exceptionally high conductivity and fast ionic diffusion due to the substitution of V, facilitating lithiation/delithiation behavior, and induce a fine nanosized structure with a reduced volume change are prepared. As a result, the stress and strain are alleviated during the Li-ion intercalation/deintercalation processes, improving the cycling stability and rate capability. Such a large improvement in the electrochemical properties can be ascribed to the stabilizing effect of V, the small migration energy barrier, and short diffusion path, which arise from the introduction of V into MoO3.

	abstract = {Rechargeable positive electrodes for ambient temperature Li-batteries are mainly based on the same general principle: reversible topotactic Li+-intercalation into transition metal chalcogenide host lattices, yielding ternary phases LinMChx. After an intercalation/deintercalation cycle the original host lattice may be retained practically unchanged if the structure of the host matrix is determined by strong covalent bonds and if the concentration of intercalated ions was small. On the other hand, high concentration of unsolvated Li+ ions in fairly ionic oxide host lattices such as MoO3, Cr2O5 or Cr3O8 (CrOx) cause significant irreversible structural and also morphological changes of the host matrix. Moreover, ternary oxides LinMOx prepared at room temperature are non-equilibrium phases — their structural parameters and transport properties vary with conditions of preparation, ageing time etc., and elevated temperature finally causes a complete and irreversible breakdown of their original structure. Prolonged cycling of crystalline large particle size MoO3 leaves quasi-amorphous powders which, however, are still usable for rechargeable cathodes. Failure of LinMoO3 and LinCrOx electrodes is due to recrystallization via solution, forming e.g. Li2MoO4 from LinMoO3. To obtain a better understanding of the limitations of MoO3 and CrOx cathodes under practical operation conditions changes in structure and morphology during electrochemical and chemical lithiation and after electrochemical cycling were followed by X-ray diffraction and SEM micrographs; supplementary results were obtained by electrochemical methods and by thermal analysis. Electronically conducting preparations of “hexagonal MoO3” (which is a hydrated MoO3 modification) were also characterized with respect to their discharge behaviour and reversibility in organic Li+-electrolytes − their “sloping” discharge characteristics disqualify them for practical applications.},

A thorough mixing of these slurries poses a major challenge in the battery manufacturing process. Several types of mixing devices and mixing methods were examined. The conventional turbine stirrers or ball mill mixers could be adequately used for the preparation of anode slurries, but not suitable for cathode slurries. In this study, a newly three-dimensional mixer, in conjunction with a multi-stage mixing sequence was proposed. The mixing effectiveness was examined by means of rheological measurements and flow visualization techniques. Preliminary electrical performance results indicated that the battery obtained using the 3D mixing device with a multi-stage mixing sequence was more efficient to those obtained from conventional methods.},

The former process gives the slurry that is more suitable for electrode preparation with fluid-like behavior and more uniform dispersion of solid ingredients as compared to those prepared from the letter. In the composite electrode prepared from the former, the LiCoO2 and carbon particles are homogeneously distributed without agglomeration. Indebted to this favorable feature, this electrode exhibits a better electrochemical performance for cyclability and rate capability. It is very likely that the contact resistance and charge transfer resistance for lithiation/de-lithiation are smaller in the former electrode due to the homogeneous distribution of LiCoO2 and carbon particles, which leads to a less significant electrode polarization.},

The electronic conductivity of the AB/PVDF composites at different compositions was measured with a four-point probe direct current method. The electronic conductivity was found to increase rapidly and plateau at an AB:PVDF ratio 0.2:1 (by weight), with 0.8:1 being the highest conductivity composition.

Electrodes of each of those compositions were fabricated with different fractions of AB/PVDF to active material. It was found that at the 0.8:1 AB:PVDF, the rate performance improved with increases in the AB/PVDF loading, whereas at the 0.2:1 AB:PVDF, the rate performance improved with decreases in the AB/PVDF loading.

The process uses a water-based slurry to cast the electrodes, using poly vinylidene-fluoride (PVDF) as a polymeric binder. The use of aqueous PVDF latex as a binder in positive electrodes is of difficult integration in existing production lines due to the low stability of lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) in an aqueous environment. The use of electroless plating solves this issue by coating LiCoO2 particles with a copper-based layer stable to water. The presence of copper on the surface of the powders is confirmed by means of SEM, XRF and conductivity measurements of the powders. Electrochemical characterization of the electrodes has been carried out with cycling tests in coin cells, confirming the cycling stability during charge/discharge cycles. Cycling performances of the water-based cathodes containing coated active material particles are comparable to a reference NMP-based cathode, while uncoated particles show a sensibly lower capacity retention during cycling. The possibility of up-scaling the metallization process has been tested with the use of a semi-industrial pilot filter dryer.},

Here, we show that few- and single-layered BN nanoribbons, mostly terminated with zigzag edges, can be produced under unwrapping multiwalled BN nanotubes through plasma etching. The interesting stepwise unwrapping and intermediate states were observed and analyzed. Opposed to insulating primal tubes, the nanoribbons become semiconducting due to doping-like conducting edge states and vacancy defects, as revealed by structural analyses and ab initio simulations.

Nevertheless, ASSBs have so far been mainly investigated using lab-scale dry mixing processes and therefore suffer from limitation of scalability and agglomeration of active particles in the composite electrodes. Here, we report a systematic investigation on ASSBs fabricated by a solution-based casting process. By screening a wide range of binders and solvents, acrylonitrile butadiene rubber and para-xylene were a suitable binder and solvent, respectively, compatible with sulfide glass-ceramic solid electrolyte. This binder-solvent combination facilitates homogeneous dispersion of the solid electrolyte in the slurry and electrolyte layer, offering high adhesion between electrode materials and comparable lithium ionic conductivity to that of the dry mixing-based counterpart. When solution-based casting processes were adopted for both electrolyte and composite cathode (containing LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2) layers, the solution-processed cell exhibits decent performance in rate capability and cyclability due to higher homogeneity of the electrode components, originating from the appropriate combination of solvent and binder.},

	abstract = {Research into new and improved materials to be utilized in lithium-ion batteries (LIB) necessitates an experimental counterpart to any computational analysis. Testing of lithium-ion batteries in an academic setting has taken on several forms, but at the most basic level lies the coin cell construction. In traditional LIB electrode preparation, a multi-phase slurry composed of active material, binder, and conductive additive is cast out onto a substrate. An electrode disc can then be punched from the dried sheet and used in the construction of a coin cell for electrochemical evaluation. Utilization of the potential of the active material in a battery is critically dependent on the microstructure of the electrode, as an appropriate distribution of the primary components are crucial to ensuring optimal electrical conductivity, porosity, and tortuosity, such that electrochemical and transport interaction is optimized. Processing steps ranging from the combination of dry powder, wet mixing, and drying can all critically affect multi-phase interactions that influence the microstructure formation. Electrochemical probing necessitates the construction of electrodes and coin cells with the utmost care and precision. This paper aims at providing a step-by-step guide of non-aqueous electrode processing and coin cell construction for lithium-ion batteries within an academic setting and with emphasis on deciphering the influence of drying and calendaring.},

PBA binder has a low-glass transition temperature of 10°C, which can improve the flexibility of the electrode. This new composite binder has a very good binding ability as same as the typical organic solvent-based binder, poly(vinylidene fluoride). The dispersions of the water-based cathode slurries with the composite binder were measured by analyzing the viscosity and sedimentation behaviors. The results show that the new composite binder can well disperse the LiCoO2. Moreover, using the new composite binder could greatly improve the rate capabilities and the cycle stability of water-based LiCoO2 cathodes.},

	abstract = {The primary current‐collector materials being used in lithium‐ion cells are susceptible to environmental degradation: aluminum to pitting corrosion and copper to environmentally assisted cracking. Localized corrosion occurred on bare aluminum electrodes during simulated ambient‐temperature cycling in an excess of electrolyte. The highly oxidizing potential associated with the positive‐electrode charge condition was the primary factor. The corrosion mechanism differed from the pitting typically observed in aqueous electrolytes because each site was filled with a mixed metal/metal‐oxide product, forming surface mounds or nodules. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was shown to be an effective analytical tool for characterizing the corrosion behavior of aluminum under these conditions. Based on X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, little difference existed in the composition of the surface film on aluminum and copper after immersion or cycling in electrolytes made with two different solvent formulations. Although Li and P were the predominant adsorbed surface species, the corrosion resistance of aluminum may simply be due to its native oxide. Finally, copper was shown to be susceptible to environmental cracking at or near the lithium potential when specific metallurgical conditions existed (work hardening and large grain size). © 1999 The Electrochemical Society.

The progress in nanotechnology provides appropriate 3D current collectors characterized by highly efficient morphologies and architectures. In particular, 3D current collectors with different morphology are classified. Critical factors of current collectors that affect the electrochemical performance of Li-based batteries are comprehensively debated.

	abstract = {This paper examines several metals that are commonly employed as current collectors of positive and negative electrodes for rechargeable lithium batteries. Current collectors must be electrochemically stable when in contact with the cell component during the potential operation window of an electrode. Various electrochemical techniques have been used to investigate the corrosion of current collector materials. In practice, continued corrosion of current collectors leads to a gradual increase in the internal resistance of cells, which causes the capacity to fade gradually. Corrosion of the current collector may induce a short-circuit, affecting its safety. Thus, the formation of thick and compact, protective passive film on the metal surface is highly important so as to ensure battery performance and safety. Depending on the salts and additives, different types of protective films are formed. The solubility of these surface layers in the electrolyte is a determining factor in the overall stability of the current collector. In this review, we introduce the electrochemical behavior and protective film formation processes of various metallic current collectors in representative electrolytes.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional carbon nitride is considered a very good battery electrode material owing to its uniform-size pores and the presence of nitrogen atoms. First-principles calculations were used to investigate the adsorption and storage of lithium and sodium on monolayer g-C2N. The capacities of lithium and sodium ion batteries for monolayer g-C2N are 596 (LiC2N) and 276 (NaC4N2) mAh/g, respectively. The average Li binding energy reaches 2.39 eV relative to isolated Li atoms, which suggests that the lithium capacity achieved on g-C2N might not be sustained during cycling. By varying the ratio of C to N atoms, it is found that the average Li binding energy is reduced to only 1.69 eV for C:N {\textasciitilde} 5:1, indicating a significant improvement in cycling performance while maintaining the reversible capacity. The mobility barrier energies to Li ion diffusion between two layers in bulk structures with AA and AB stacking sequences are 0.25 and 1.23 eV, respectively, indicating that high Li ion conductivity could be achieved in bulk g-C2N with AA stacking. These calculations demonstrate that graphitic carbon nitride with uniform-size pores can be used as an electrode material with high capacity and high lithium mobility.},

However, it remains unexplored to further enlarge the interlayer spacing and reveal the influence of heteroatom doping on carbon nanostructures for developing more efficient SIB anode materials. Here, a series of N-rich few-layer graphene (N-FLG) with tuneable interlayer distance ranging from 0.45 to 0.51 nm is successfully synthesized by annealing graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) under zinc catalysis and selected temperature (T = 700, 800, and 900 °C). More significantly, the correlation between N dopants and interlayer distance of resultant N-FLG-T highlights the effect of pyrrolic N on the enlargement of graphene interlayer spacing, due to its stronger electrostatic repulsion. As a consequence, N-FLG-800 achieves the optimal properties in terms of interlayer spacing, nitrogen configuration and electronic conductivity. When used as an anode for SIBs, N-FLG-800 shows remarkable Na+ storage performance with ultrahigh rate capability (56.6 mAh g−1 at 40 A g−1) and excellent long-term stability (211.3 mAh g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 after 2000 cycles), demonstrating the effectiveness of material design.},

Molybdenum disulfide is a highly promising material for LIBs that compensates for its intermediate insertion voltage (∼2 V vs. Li/Li+) with a high reversible capacity (up to 1290 mA h g−1) and an excellent rate capability (e.g. 554 mA h g−1 after 20 cycles at 50 C). Several themes emerge when surveying the scientific literature on the subject: first, we argue that there is excellent data to show that truly nanoscale structures, which often contain a nanodispersed carbon phase, consistently possess superior charge storage capacity and cycling performance. We provide several hypotheses regarding why the measured capacities in such architectures are well above the theoretical predictions of the known MoS2 intercalation and conversion reactions. Second, we highlight the growing microstructural and electrochemical evidence that the layered MoS2 structure does not survive past the initial lithiation cycle, and that subsequently the electrochemically active material is actually elemental sulfur. Third, we show that certain synthesis techniques are consistently demonstrated to be the most promising for battery applications, and describe these in detail. Fourth, we present our selection of synthesis methods that we believe to have a high potential for creating improved MoS2 LIB electrodes, but are yet to be tried.},

Synthetic methods are designed primarily focusing on high capacities. The achieved performance is often the collective results of several contributing factors. It is important to decouple the factors and understand their functions individually. This work presents a study focusing on an individual factor, crystallinity, by taking MoS2 as a demonstrator. The performance of low and high-crystallized MoS2 is compared to show the function of crystallinity is dependent on the electrochemical mechanism. Lower crystallinity can alleviate diffusional limitation in 0.5–3.0 V, where intercalation reaction takes charge in storing K-ions. Higher crystallinity can ensure the structural stability of the MoS2 layers and promote surface charge storage in 0.01–3.0 V, where conversion reaction mainly contributes. The low-crystallized MoS2 exhibits an intercalation capacity (118 mAh g−1), good cyclability (85\% over 100 cycles), and great rate capability (41 mAh g−1 at 2 A g−1), and the high-crystallized MoS2 delivers a high capacity of 330 mAh g−1 at 1 A g−1 and retains 161 mAh g−1 at 20 A g−1, being one of the best among the reported LS-TMDs in KIBs.},

Reversible intercalation, or insertion, of lithium into the carbon host lattice avoids the problem of lithium dendrite formation and provides large improvement in terms of cycleability and safety. This paper reviews the main achievements on performance and understanding of charge–discharge mechanisms, resulting from the tremendous activity devoted to these systems in the past few years. As a matter of fact, all carbon materials can be lithiated to a certain extent. However, the amount of lithium reversibly incorporated in the carbon lattice (the reversible capacity), the faradaic losses during the first charge–discharge cycle (the irreversible capacity), the profile of the voltage curves during charging and discharging, all depend on the structure, the texture and heteroatom content of the carbon material. In this paper, we successively examine the electrochemical behaviour of the main families of materials, namely, natural and synthetic graphites, graphitizable carbons, low-temperature and non-graphitizing carbons, and doped carbons.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses some important aspects of the correlation between surface chemistry, 3D structure, and the electrochemical behavior of lithiated graphite electrodes. By reviewing results obtained with different electrolyte solutions (e.g. ethylene carbonate-based solutions, propylene carbonate solutions, and ether-based systems), we describe the stabilization and capacity fading mechanisms of graphite electrodes. One of the failure mechanisms occurs at potentials {\textgreater}0.5 V Li/Li+, and relates to an increase in the electrode's impedance due to improper passivation and a simultaneous change in the electrode's morphology, probably due to gas formation. At low potentials (depending on the electrolyte solution involved), phenomena such as exfoliation and amorphization of the graphite electrodes can be observed. Stabilization mechanisms are also discussed. In general, surface stabilization of the graphite is essential for obtaining reversible lithiation and a long electrode cycle life. The latter usually relates to precipitation of highly compact and insoluble surface species, which adhere well, and irreversibly, to the active surface. Hence, the choice of appropriate electrolyte solutions in terms of solvents, salts and additives is very critical for the use of graphite anodes in Li batteries. The major analytical tools for this study included FTIR and impedance spectroscopies, XPS, and in situ and ex situ XRD in conjunction with standard electrochemical techniques.},

	abstract = {Li electrodes in any relevant electrolyte solution (i.e., polar aprotic) are covered by surface films of a very complicated structure. It was found that even in cases where the surface films formed on lithium contain elastomers, or where the lithium metal reactivity is reduced by doping with elements such as N, As, Al, Mg, Ca, etc., it is impossible to achieve sufficient passivation with lithium electrodes and liquid solutions. Passivation is considerably worsened when Li electrodes are operated at high rates (especially at high charging, Li deposition rates). Thus, there is no way that rechargeable Li batteries can compete with Li-ion batteries in any application that requires high charging rates (e.g., in powering portable electronic devices). The electrochemical behavior of lithiated graphite electrodes also depends on passivation phenomena. The surface films formed on lithiated graphite are similar to those formed on Li metal in the same solutions. The volume changes of graphite electrodes during Li insertion–deinsertion are small enough to enable their reasonable passivation in a variety of electrolyte solutions. A critical factor that determines the stability of graphite electrodes is their morphology. It was found that the shape of graphite particles plays a key role in their application as active mass in anodes for Li-ion batteries.},

	abstract = {Supercapacitors (also known as ‘ultracapacitors’) offer a promising alternative approach to meeting the increasing power demands of energy-storage systems in general, and of portable (digital) electronic devices in particular. Supercapacitors are able to store and deliver energy at relatively high rates (beyond those accessible with batteries) because the mechanism of energy storage is simple charge-separation (as in conventional capacitors). The vast increases in capacitance achieved by supercapacitors are due to the combination of: (i) an extremely small distance that separates the opposite charges, as defined by the electric double-layer; (ii) highly porous electrodes that embody very high surface-area. A variety of porous forms of carbon are currently preferred as the electrode materials because they have exceptionally high surface areas, relatively high electronic conductivity, and acceptable cost. The power and energy-storage capabilities of these devices are closely linked to the physical and chemical characteristics of the carbon electrodes. For example, increases in specific surface-area, obtained through activation of the carbon, generally lead to increased capacitance. Since only the electrolyte-wetted surface-area contributes to capacitance, the carbon processing is required to generate predominantly ‘open’ pores that are connected to the bulk pore network. While the supercapacitors available today perform well, it is generally agreed that there is considerable scope for improvement (e.g., improved performance at higher frequencies). Thus it is likely that carbon will continue to play a principal role in supercapacitor technology, mainly through further optimization of porosity, surface treatments to promote wettability, and reduced inter-particle contact resistance.},

They can complement or replace batteries in electrical energy storage and harvesting applications, when high power delivery or uptake is needed. A notable improvement in performance has been achieved through recent advances in understanding charge storage mechanisms and the development of advanced nanostructured materials. The discovery that ion desolvation occurs in pores smaller than the solvated ions has led to higher capacitance for electrochemical double layer capacitors using carbon electrodes with subnanometre pores, and opened the door to designing high-energy density devices using a variety of electrolytes. Combination of pseudo-capacitive nanomaterials, including oxides, nitrides and polymers, with the latest generation of nanostructured lithium electrodes has brought the energy density of electrochemical capacitors closer to that of batteries. The use of carbon nanotubes has further advanced micro-electrochemical capacitors, enabling flexible and adaptable devices to be made.

Various types of G6-TMD nanomaterials, such as nanosheets, nanotubes and quantum dot nano-objects and flower-like nanostructures, have been synthesized. High thermodynamic stability under ambient conditions, even in atomically thin form, made nanosheets of these inorganic semiconductors a valuable asset in the existing library of two-dimensional (2D) materials, along with the well-known semimetallic graphene and insulating hexagonal boron nitride. G6-TMDs generally possess an appropriate bandgap (1–2 eV) which is tunable by size and dimensionality and changes from indirect to direct in monolayer nanosheets, intriguing for (opto)electronic, sensing, and solar energy harvesting applications. Moreover, rich intercalation chemistry and abundance of catalytically active edge sites make them promising for fabrication of novel energy storage devices and advanced catalysts. In this review, we provide an overview on all aspects of the basic science, physicochemical properties and characterization techniques as well as all existing production methods and applications of G6-TMD nanomaterials in a comprehensive yet concise treatment.

The unsaturated Se atoms at the edge and those at defective points or altered basal plane have superior electrocatalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and similar electrocatalytic reactions (e.g., in lithium–oxygen batteries).

Size-controlled polystyrene nanobeads in the form of an aqueous suspension are introduced for the first time as an electrospinning solution, which enables the precise control of void size and uniform distribution of nanovoids in the one-dimensional (1D) nanostructure. The discharge capacity and Coulombic efficiency of the porous MoSe2/C composite nanofibers after the 200th cycle at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 are 454 mA h g−1 and 98.4\%, implying efficient Na+ ion insertion and extraction in the composites. In addition, a high discharge capacity of 280 mA h g−1 at a current density of 7.0 A g−1 demonstrates an excellent rate capability and fast Na+ ion and electron transfer. Few-layered MoSe2 and highly conductive carbon facilitate ion and electron diffusion during cycling. Uniformly distributed nanovoids in the structure can accommodate the volume expansion induced by electrochemical reaction of Na+ ions with the composites and allow efficient penetration of electrolyte into electrodes.},

As shown the experiences of Li/Na-Se batteries, the encapsulating of the exfoliated MoSe2 into carbon nanospheres are successfully constructed with the introduction of C-O-Mo bonds and larger layer distance (0.89 nm). Interestingly, the C-O-Mo bonds stayed on the surface of the Se-O insulation layer can improve the rate of ions transfer and also promote the reversible conversion of MoSe2. The first-principles calculations demonstrated that the frontier molecular orbitals of C-O-Mo interface structure are mainly localized on the MoSe2 sheet fragment with an appropriate HOMO-LUMO gap ({\textless}4 eV), proving that its conductivity is being greatly enhanced with higher stability. Utilized as an anode for LIBs, it delivers Li-storage capacities of 1208 mAh g−1 after 150 cycles at 1.0 A g−1 and 519 mAh g−1 after 200 cycles at 4.0 A g−1. Also note that the Na-storage capacities are found to be 543, 491 mAh g−1 after 120 cycles at 0.1, 1.0 A g−1, respectively. Through the analysis of CV, the reduced particles might improve the capacitive behaviors, further leading to the higher rate performances. Ex-situ techniques showed that the emerging Se during the electrochemical process was constrained uniformly in the carbon matrix. More greatly, the controlling of by-product Se plays key roles in achieving high-rate capability and cycling stability, which would open up a potential avenue for these metal-selenide anodes designs of battery storage systems.},

Considerable efforts on nanostructured electrode materials have been made in recent years to fulfill the future requirements of electrochemical energy storage. Compared to bulk materials, most of these nanostructured electrode materials improve the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of electrochemical reactions for achieving high energy and power densities. Here we briefly review the state-of-the-art research activities in the area of nanostructured positive electrode materials for post-lithium ion batteries, including Li–S batteries, Li–Se batteries, aqueous rechargeable lithium batteries, Li–O2 batteries, Na-ion batteries, Mg-ion batteries and Al-ion batteries. These future rechargeable battery systems may offer increased energy densities, reduced cost, and more environmental benignity. A particular focus is directed to the design principles of these nanostructured positive electrode materials and how nanostructuring influences electrochemical performance. Moreover, the recent achievements in nanostructured positive electrode materials for some of the latest emerging rechargeable batteries are also summarized, such as Zn-ion batteries, F- and Cl-ion batteries, Na–, K– and Al–S batteries, Na– and K–O2 batteries, Li–CO2 batteries, novel Zn–air batteries, and hybrid redox flow batteries. To facilitate further research and development, some future research trends and directions are finally discussed.},

The reaction mechanism with Na does not simply go through the alloying mechanism observed for Li where the intermediate species are those expected from the phase diagram. In the case of Na, the intermediate phases are mostly amorphous and could not be precisely identified. Surprisingly, we evidenced that a competition takes place at the end of the discharge of the Sb/Na cell between the formation of the hexagonal and the cubic polymorphs of Na3Sb, the last being described in the literature as unstable at atmospheric pressure and only synthesized under high pressure (1–9 GPa). In addition, fluoroethylene carbonate added to the electrolyte combined with an appropriate electrode formulation based on carboxymethyl cellulose, carbon black, and vapor ground carbon fibers seems to be determinant in the excellent performances of this material.},

The results show that the liquid gallium negative electrode enables the reversible alloying/dealloying between Al and Ga. Remarkably, the essential problems in the solid Al negative electrodes, including dendrite, corrosion and pulverization, would be well avoided attributed to the liquid state of the Ga electrode during cycling. In addition to the enhanced stable cycling performance, Ga negative electrode is also recyclable, allowing the cycled Ga for further presenting stable cycling in the re-assembled batteries, and which is helpful for its practical application. The results in the present work open a precedent way to develop the advanced negative electrode with dendrite-free, corrosion resistant and recyclable features and advantages for various types of rechargeable batteries.},

	abstract = {To meet the growing global demand for energy while preserving the environment, it is necessary to drastically reduce the world’s dependence on non-renewable energy sources. At the core of this effort will be the ability to efficiently convert, store, transport and access energy in a variety of ways. Batteries for use in small consumer devices have saturated society; however, if they are ever to be useful in large-scale applications such as automotive transportation or grid-storage, they will require new materials with dramatically improved performance. Efforts must also focus on using Earth-abundant and nontoxic compounds so that whatever developments are made will not create new environmental problems.In this Account, we describe a general strategy for the design and development of new insertion electrode materials for Li(Na)-ion batteries that meet these requirements. We begin by reviewing the current state of the art of insertion electrodes and highlighting the intrinsic material properties of electrodes that must be re-engineered for extension to larger-scale applications. We then present a detailed discussion of the relevant criteria for the conceptual design and appropriate selection of new electrode chemical compositions.We describe how the open-circuit voltage of Li-ion batteries can be manipulated and optimized through structural and compositional tuning by exploiting differences in the electronegativity among possible electrode materials. We then discuss which modern synthetic techniques are most sustainable, allowing the creation of new materials via environmentally responsible reactions that minimize the use of energy and toxic solvents. Finally, we present a case study showing how we successfully employed these approaches to develop a large number of new, useful electrode materials within the recently discovered family of transition metal fluorosulfates. This family has attracted interest as a possible source of improved Li-ion batteries in larger scale applications and benefits from a relatively “green” synthesis.},

The main difficulty in high-rate charge−discharge experiments is kinetic problems due to the slow diffusion of Li-ions in electrodes. Nanosizing is a popular way to achieve a higher surface area and shorter Li-ion diffusion length for fast diffusion. However, while various nanoelectrodes that provide excellent high-rate capability have been synthesized, a size-controlled synthesis and a systematic study of nanocrystalline LiCoO2 have not been carried out because of the difficulty in controlling the size. We have established the size-controlled synthesis of nanocrystalline LiCoO2 through a hydrothermal reaction and, for the first time, clarified the structural and electrochemical properties of this intercalation cathode material. Lattice expansion in nanocrystalline LiCoO2 was found from powder X-ray diffraction measurements and Raman spectroscopy. Electrochemical measurements and theoretical analyses on nanocrystalline LiCoO2 revealed that extreme size reduction below 15 nm was not favorable for most applications. An excellent high-rate capability (65\% of the 1 C rate capability at 100 C) was observed in nanocrystalline LiCoO2 with an appropriate particle size of 17 nm.},

	abstract = {The status of ambient temperature sodium ion batteries is reviewed in light of recent developments in anode, electrolyte and cathode materials. These devices, although early in their stage of development, are promising for large-scale grid storage applications due to the abundance and very low cost of sodium-containing precursors used to make the components. The engineering knowledge developed recently for highly successful Li ion batteries can be leveraged to ensure rapid progress in this area, although different electrode materials and electrolytes will be required for dual intercalation systems based on sodium. In particular, new anode materials need to be identified, since the graphite anode, commonly used in lithium systems, does not intercalate sodium to any appreciable extent. A wider array of choices is available for cathodes, including high performance layered transition metal oxides and polyanionic compounds. Recent developments in electrodes are encouraging, but a great deal of research is necessary, particularly in new electrolytes, and the understanding of the SEI films. The engineering modeling calculations of Na-ion battery energy density indicate that 210 Wh kg−1 in gravimetric energy is possible for Na-ion batteries compared to existing Li-ion technology if a cathode capacity of 200 mAh g−1 and a 500 mAh g−1 anode can be discovered with an average cell potential of 3.3 V.},

	abstract = {A low-cost, high-capacity Al-graphite rechargeable aluminum-ion battery is confirmed to be able to work stably in a quaternary AlCl3-NaCl-LiCl-KCl inorganic molten salt as electrolyte with the lowest eutectic temperature of less than 75 °C. The battery shows a stable specific capacity of 114.9 mAh g−1 at 200 mA g−1 over 1500 cycles at 90 °C. Moreover, the capacity can remain at ∼85 mAh g−1 with a higher current density of 800 mA g−1 over 2600 cycles at 90 °C. Importantly, even cycled at 80 °C and 100 °C, almost 100\% capacity retention can be achieved after 5800 cycles when the temperature is back to 90 °C, verifying the superior long-term cycling stability under various temperatures. The inherent low-cost and high capacity, as well as outstanding long-term cycling stability, makes it particularly favorable for large-scale energy storage devices.},

The size of the pores varied in micro-mesopore regions and exhibited three-dimensional sheet-like morphology composed of multilayered graphene sheets with an inter planar distance of 0.360 nm. The GPCS material was tested as anode for Li-ion battery (LIB) application in half cell mode (vs Li+/Li). The fabricated GPCS electrode shows excellent electrochemical properties in comparison with commercial graphite such as a high discharge specific capacity of 1022 mA h g-1 after 10 cycles at 100 mA g-1 and excellent specific capacity retention of 170 mA h g-1 at a very high current rate of 8000 mA g-1 and also retains a high capacity of 541 mA h g-1 after 250 cycles at 500 mA g-1, which suggests that GPCS material can be a promising electrode for LIB application. A brief comparison with commercial graphite and various carbonaceous materials from literature demonstrated that the GPCS electrode was potential material for high rate LIBs.},

In this work, the edible fungus slag-derived porous carbon (PC) is adopted as a carbon matrix to combine with RP to form PC@RP composites through a facile vaporization-condensation approach. The nano-sized RP particles are uniformly distributed in the PC matrix. The conductive porous carbon architecture improves the transfer of electron and Na+ in the composite. The robust carbon framework together with the chemical bonding between PC and RP effectively buffer the huge volumetric change of RP. As a result, the PC@RP composite material delivers a specific capacity of 670 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 with a capacity retention of 87\% after 100 charging/discharging cycles. In particular, the full SIB assembled with P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn1/3Ti1/3O2 as the cathode material and PC@RP as the anode material exhibits a specific capacity of 77.3 mA h g-1 (based on the mass of the composite cathode material) at 0.5 C, and 85\% capacity is retained after 100 charging/discharging cycles.},

We present a hexagonal structure of MoO 3 microrods as an Al-ion intercalation host material and show its first-time use as a potential electrode for an aqueous Al ion battery system.

Three coals from different regions of Colombia were activated with CO2, steam and a CO2–steam mixture. Coal from the Antioquia Region (La Capotera) was activated with a CO2–steam mixture at 1073, 1123 and 1173 K and with CO2 and steam at 1073 K. Other two coals from Antioquia and Cesar regions (La Grande and Borrego) regions were activated with a CO2–steam mixture at 1073 K and these were compared with the La Capotera char for the same conditions. The content of ash was confirmed to affect the development of surface area: coals with lower amount of ash developed higher specific surface areas. Activation temperature also affected the development of surface area: the use of high temperature produced low surface areas. Results indicate that CO2–steam produces larger surface areas than CO2 and steam alone, and reactions with CO2–steam and CO2 develop a more uniform porosity than reaction with steam. The pore sizes are larger when steam is used and smaller when CO2 is used.},

The morphology of human hair samples before and after pyrolysis was characterized using scanning electron microscopy. The chemical composition of natural and pyrolyzed human hairs was also characterized using Raman spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Screen printed carbon electrodes were modified with the hair-derived carbons and applied for electrochemical sensing of dopamine and ascorbic acid. The hair-derived carbons significantly improved the performance of the electrochemical sensors compared to the unmodified sensors. This method provides an easy, simple, and inexpensive way to fabricate hollow 3D glassy carbon microelectrodes.},

ACHH delivered a specific capacitance of ∼115Fg−1 at a current density of 100mAg−1 in single electrode configuration with Li in the presence of organic medium. This result was followed by the fabrication of symmetric supercapacitor and delivered an energy density of 19.2Whkg−1. The energy density has been further improved by introducing an insertion type electrode, Li4Ti5O12 in Li-ion hybrid electrochemical capacitor (Li-HEC) assembly. The combined battery-supercapacitor type reactions in Li-HEC recorded the maximum energy density of 23Whkg−1. An excellent cycleability is noted for both symmetric and Li-HEC in an organic medium.},

Cycling of these composite electrodes at low voltages demonstrates charge storage at the operating potentials of viable anodes, however, the conductive carbon additive is also able to store charge in the low potential regime. The contribution of the conductive carbon additives to the observed capacity is often neglected when interpreting the electrochemical performance of electrodes. To provide a reference for the contribution of the carbons to the observed capacity, we report the charge storage behavior of two common conductive carbon additives Super P and Ketjenblack as a function of voltage, rate, and electrolyte composition. Both carbons exhibit substantial capacities after 100 cycles, up to 150 mAh g−1, when cycled to 10 mV. The capacity is dependent on the discharge cutoff voltage and cycling rate with some dependence on electrolyte composition. The first few cycles are dominated by the formation of the SEI followed by a fade to a steady, reversible capacity thereafter. Neglecting the capacity of the carbon additive can lead to significant errors in the estimation of charge storage capabilities of the active material.},

XPS analysis shows that the mixed acid oxidation produces carbonyl (C=O) and the carboxyl (O-C=O) groups, the air oxidation results in hydroxyl and the smallest amount of carbonyl and carboxyl groups, and both the nitric acid and potassium permanganate treatments result in a moderate amount of carbonyl and carboxyl groups. It was found that the specific surface area and pore structures of the four samples are similar and carbonyl and carboxyl groups contribute the most to pseudo-capacitance through a Faradic reaction. In particular, the carbonyl group has a proportional relationship to the capacitance of CNTs. However, the hydroxyl group does not lead to an obvious increase of pseudo-capacitance, but can increase the electric double layer capacitance. The carbonyl and the carboxyl groups are advantageous for fast Faradic reactions to introduce pseudo-capacitance, owing to their lower charge transfer resistance than that of the hydroxyl group.},

	abstract = {For incompletely reduced graphene oxides (RGOs), an effect of oxygen functional groups such as carboxyl, phenol, carbonyl, and quinone on electrochemical capacitive behavior was studied. To prepare RGO thin-film electrodes, a simple fabrication process by (i) dropping and evaporating the graphene oxide (GO) solution, (ii) irradiating pulsed light, and (iii) heat-treating at 200 ∼ 360°C was applied. It was notable that the pulsed light irradiation was effective to prevent the disfiguring of deposited GO thin-film during the thermal reduction. From XRD analyses, interlayer distances of the RGOs were gradually decreased from 0.379 to 0.354nm. As increasing the thermal reduction temperature from 200 to 360°C, XPS O 1s spectra analyses showed that the atomic percentages of carboxyl and phenol of the RGOs were sustained as 5.40±0.36 and 4.77±0.41 at\% respectively. Meanwhile, those of carbonyl and quinone of the RGOs were gradually declined from 3.10 to 1.81 and from 1.32 to 0.65 at\% with different thermal reduction temperature respectively. For all RGO thin-film electrodes, the specific capacitance from the CV measurement in 6M KOH was sustained as ca. 220 F g−1 at the scan of 5mV s−1. However, in 1M H2SO4, the specific capacitance was gradually decreased from 171 to 136 F g−1. After 100,000 cycles in 6M KOH, 1M H2SO4, and 0.5M Na2SO4, the RGO (200°C) electrodes showed ca. 92, 54, and 104\% of the initial capacitances respectively. The atomic percentages of the oxygen functional groups involved in the pseudocapacitive Faradaic reaction were decreased after the cycle test. Especially in 1M H2SO4, quinone group was decreased to ca. 48\% of initial atomic percentage, which seems to be a main reason for the drastic reduction of capacitance. The specific pseudocapacitance per unit atomic percentage for either carboxyl or phenol group in 6M KOH was obtained as 12.59 F g−1 at\%−1. For carbonyl group in 1M H2SO4, it was a slightly deviated value as 13.55 F g−1 at\%−1. For quinone group in 1M H2SO4, it was 27.09 F g−1at\%−1.},

	abstract = {This article aims to offer a critical overview of selected literature on capacitive and non-capacitive faradaic charge storage. It is particularly relevant to the concept of pseudocapacitance that is generally described as a result of fast surface faradaic processes. In general, faradaic processes represent electron transfer reactions at the interface between an electrode and its contacting solid or liquid electrolyte phase that is able to accept or donate electrons. Obviously, not all faradaic processes can be associated with pseudocapacitance. The question is how to differentiate pseudocapacitance related faradaic charge storage from the others. Therefore, attempts have been made to apply the band model for semiconductors to account qualitatively for the origin of pseudocapacitance. Capacitive and non-capacitive faradaic processes are then proposed to define and differentiate different charge storage mechanisms in supercapacitor and battery. On the other hand, the unequal electrode capacitance approach and the use of Ca2+ in aqueous electrolytes are discussed in relation with enhanced energy capacity of supercapacitors. In addition, the principle of supercapattery as a hybrid device is explained with recent literature examples.},

The method is based on step potential electrochemical spectroscopy (SPECS), and its application is demonstrated on activated carbon electrodes in aqueous media. The method involves applying a sequence of small potential steps (±25 mV) across the electrochemical window of the electrode material, with sufficient rest time between steps to allow for current equilibration. Modelling of the resultant i-t data using combined resistive, capacitive, diffusional and residual current terms allows for separation of the faradaic and non-faradaic terms. The behavior of these contributions across the electrode potential window is reported and discussed in comparison with conventional methods of electrochemical analysis, such as cyclic voltammetry.},

	abstract = {Lithium metal phosphates are amongst the most promising cathode materials for high capacity lithium-ion batteries. Owing to their inherently low electronic conductivity, it is essential to optimize their properties to minimize defect concentration and crystallite size (down to the submicron level), control morphology, and to decorate the crystallite surfaces with conductive nanostructures that act as conduits to deliver electrons to the bulk lattice. Here, we discuss factors relating to doping and defects in olivine phosphates LiMPO4 (M = Fe, Mn, Co, Ni) and describe methods by which in situ nanophase composites with conductivities ranging from 10(-4)-10(-2) S cm(-1) can be prepared. These utilize surface reactivity to produce intergranular nitrides, phosphides, and/or phosphocarbides at temperatures as low as 600 degrees C that maximize the accessibility of the bulk for Li de/insertion. Surface modification can only address the transport problem in part, however. A key issue in these materials is also to unravel the factors governing ion and electron transport within the lattice. Lithium de/insertion in the phosphates is accompanied by two-phase transitions owing to poor solubility of the single phase compositions, where low mobility of the phase boundary limits the rate characteristics. Here we discuss concerted mobility of the charge carriers. Using Mössbauer spectroscopy to pinpoint the temperature at which the solid solution forms, we directly probe small polaron hopping in the solid solution Li(x)FePO4 phases formed at elevated temperature, and give evidence for a strong correlation between electron and lithium delocalization events that suggests they are coupled.},

Breakthroughs in cathodes, anodes, and electrolyte materials are needed to reach high power and energy density in lithium ion batteries. The electrochemical performance (cycling stability, power density, and reversibility) depends on the morphological and compositional characteristics of the electrode materials, which could be controlled during the synthesis and also the annealing process. Enormous leverage can result from the advances in nanostructured electrode materials. Nano sized electrodes exhibit minimal impedance growth, which means no substantial loss of power with cycling, also increase the electrode/electrolyte contact area, which in turn increase the charge/discharge rate to achieve maximum power.

Accounting for the total mass of the electrode, the maximum specific capacity of the UGF/LFP cathode was 23\% higher than that of the Al/LFP cathode and 170\% higher than that of the Ni-foam/LFP cathode. Using UGF, both a higher rate capability and specific capacity can be achieved simultaneously, owing to its conductive (∼1.3 × 105 S m–1 at room temperature) and three-dimensional lightweight (∼9.5 mg cm–3) graphitic structure. Meanwhile, UGF presents excellent electrochemical stability comparing to that of Al and Ni foils, which are generally used as conductive substrates in lithium ion batteries. Moreover, preparation of the UGF electrode was facile, cost-effective, and compatible with various electrochemically active materials.},

However, the comprehensive effects of temperature on the cyclic aging rate of LiB have yet to be found. We use an electrochemistry-based model (ECBE) here to measure the effects on the aging behavior of cycled LiB operating within the temperature range of 25 °C to 55 °C. The increasing degradation rate of the maximum charge storage of LiB during cycling at elevated temperature is found to relate mainly to the degradations at the electrodes and that the degradation of LCO cathode is larger than graphite anode at elevated temperature. In particular, the formation and modification of the surface films on the electrodes as well as structural/phase changes of the LCO electrode, as reported in the literatures, are found to be the main contributors to the increasing degradation rate of the maximum charge storage of LiB with temperature for the specific operating temperature range. Larger increases in the Warburg elements and cell impedance are also found with cycling at higher temperature, but they do not seriously affect the state of health (SoH) of LiB as shown in this work.},

	abstract = {Ionically conducting polymer membranes (polymer electrolytes) might enhance lithium-battery technology by replacing the liquid electrolyte currently in use and thereby enabling the fabrication of flexible, compact, laminated solid-state structures free from leaks and available in varied geometries1. Polymer electrolytes explored for these purposes are commonly complexes of a lithium salt (LiX) with a high-molecular-weight polymer such as polyethylene oxide (PEO). But PEO tends to crystallize below 60 °C, whereas fast ion transport is a characteristic of the amorphous phase. So the conductivity of PEO–LiX electrolytes reaches practically useful values (of about 10−4 S cm−1) only at temperatures of 60–80 °C. The most common approach for lowering the operational temperature has been to add liquid plasticizers, but this promotes deterioration of the electrolyte's mechanical properties and increases its reactivity towards the lithium metal anode. Here we show that nanometre-sized ceramic powders can perform as solid plasticizers for PEO, kinetically inhibiting crystallization on annealing from the amorphous state above 60 °C. We demonstrate conductivities of around 10−4 S cm−1 at 50 °C and 10−5 S cm−1 at 30 °C in a PEO–LiClO4 mixture containing powders of TiO2 and Al2O3 with particle sizes of 5.8–13 nm. Further optimization might lead to practical solid-state polymer electrolytes for lithium batteries.},

The initial discharge capacity was about 370 mA h (g-CuCl2)−1 at 0.028C-rate (11 mA (g-CuCl2)−1), which was almost the same as the theoretical value (399 mA h (g-CuCl2)−1) and higher than that of insertion-type positive electrode materials as used in the rechargeable Al battery. Moreover, a two-stage discharge plateau voltage was observed at 1.5 V and 0.8 V, which was higher than other conversion type positive electrodes for the aluminum rechargeable battery. The high discharge voltage realized a high energy density of 426 mW h (g-CuCl2)−1, which is the highest energy density compared with other conversion type positive electrodes. Two different strategies were implemented to increase the lifetime of the cell, namely, increasing the upper cut-off voltage and decreasing the particle size of CuCl2.

	abstract = {Birnessite-type MnO2 (δ-MnO2) nano-sheets were successfully synthesized by an interfacial synthesis method in this work. The properties and electrochemical performance of the as-prepared δ-MnO2 were analyzed and evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen adsorption measurement and electrochemical tests. This facile synthesis method enables δ-MnO2 nano-sheets to show a large specific surface area (257.5 m2 g−1). The electrochemical test results show that the specific capacitance is 272 F g−1 and the specific capacitance retention is over 96.7\% after 1000 cycles at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. All results demonstrate that δ-MnO2 has a great potential application in high-performance electrochemical capacitors, and this interfacial synthesis method will be a very promising method to synthesize highly active MnO2 materials in a large scale.},

	abstract = {Herein we report on Li insertion into a new two-dimensional (2-D) layered Ti2C-based material (MXene) with an oxidized surface, formed by etching Al from Ti2AlC in HF at room temperature. Nitrogen sorption of treated powders showed desorption hysteresis consistent with the presence of slit-like pores. At 23m2 g−1, the specific surface area was an order of magnitude higher than untreated Ti2AlC. Cyclic voltammetry exhibited lithiation and delithiation peaks at 1.6V and 2V vs. Li+/Li, respectively. At C/25, the steady state capacity was 225mAh g−1; at 1C, it was 110mAh g−1 after 80 cycles; at 3C, it was 80mAh g−1 after 120 cycles; at 10C, it was 70mAh g−1 after 200 cycles. Since Ti2C is a member of the MXene family – where M is an early transition metal and X is C and/or N – that to date includes Ti3C2, Ta4C3, TiNbC, and (V0.5,Cr0.5)3C2, our results suggest that MXenes are promising as anode materials for Li-ion batteries.},

Cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry data showed that the current density for aluminum foil with the RTIL electrolytes was less than that of aluminum foil in the EC+DMC solutions. Besides, much corrosion pits appeared on the aluminum foil surface after the electrochemical measurement in the EC+DMC solutions, while they were not observed on the aluminum foil with the RTIL electrolytes, suggesting that aluminum current collector was stable in the RTIL electrolytes. Further research by EDX and XPS analysis revealed that a good passivating film composed mainly of the products from the oxidation between aluminum and the anions of the RTIL electrolytes on the aluminum foil surface after the anodic polarization which suppressed the aluminum corrosion.},

Herein, we report a flexible and rechargeable aluminium (Al) ion EC battery (ECB), which consists of a WO3 film as positive electrode, PET/ITO as substrate, Al sheet as negative electrode, aluminum trichloride (AlCl3) aqueous solution as electrolyte, and absorptive glass mat (AGM) as electrolyte carrier and separator. The ECB exhibits a high specific capacity of 142 mAhg−1, while demonstrating reversible color transitions between white (bleached state) and dark blue (colored state) during the cyclic charge/discharge processes. Furthermore, the ECB can work at bending angles of 0-80° with a capacity retention of 92.3\% after 40 bending cycles. The flexibility of the ECB is ascribed to the flexible, porous, and highly stable features of the AGM as well as the deformability of the PET/ITO substrate. The potential widow of the ECB can be largely enhanced by connecting small-sized ECBs internally in series while maintaining the energy density unchanged. The present study demonstrates that the ECB using the AGM as the electrolyte carrier and separator may have great potentials for the construction of both flexible, portable electronics and smart windows.},

The equimolar system is most conductive and has κ values between in the range from −31 to 123°C, respectively. The electrochemical window of DMTC‐containing sodium tetrachloroaluminate melts varied in the region of 2.5 to 2.2 V (150–170°C) depending on melt acidity and anode material. DMTC, being specifically adsorbed and reduced on the tungsten electrode surface, had an inhibiting effect on the aluminum reduction, but this effect was suppressed on the aluminum substrate. An electrochemical process with high current density (tens of milliamperes per square centimeter) was observed at 0.344 V on the acidic sodium tetrachloroaluminate background, involving a free triazolium radical mechanism. Molten electrolytes are acceptable for battery performance and both the aluminum anode and the triazolium electrolyte can be used as active materials in the acidic mixtures.},

	abstract = {Salts having a low melting point are liquid at room temperature, or even below, and form a new class of liquids usually called room temperature ionic liquids (RTIL). Information about RTILs can be found in the literature with such key words as: room temperature molten salt, low-temperature molten salt, ambient-temperature molten salt, liquid organic salt or simply ionic liquid. Their physicochemical properties are the same as high temperature ionic liquids, but the practical aspects of their maintenance or handling are different enough to merit a distinction. The class of ionic liquids, based on tetraalkylammonium cation and chloroaluminate anion, has been extensively studied since late 1970s of the XX century, following the works of Osteryoung. Systematic research on the application of chloroaluminate ionic liquids as solvents was performed in 1980s. However, ionic liquids based on aluminium halides are moisture sensitive. During the last decade an increasing number of new ionic liquids have been prepared and used as solvents. The general aim of this paper was to review the physical and chemical properties of RTILs from the point of view of their possible application as electrolytes in electrochemical processes and devices. The following points are discussed: melting and freezing, conductivity, viscosity, temperature dependence of conductivity, transport and transference numbers, electrochemical stability, possible application in aluminium electroplating, lithium batteries and in electrochemical capacitors.},

	abstract = {Li-ion capacitors (LICs) are considered one of the most promising energy storage devices due to their integrated battery and capacitor characteristics. Herein, we demonstrate a green and facile strategy to synthesize high-defect mesopore-dominant porous carbon (referred to as HDMPC) through direct pyrolysis of low-cost sheep bone in an Ar atmosphere. The HDMPC possesses large specific surface area (2192m2g−1) and high proportion of mesopore (98.0\%, accounted by pore volume), as well as numerous intrinsic defects and heteroatom-induced defects. The high defect density and unique porosity endow HDMPC electrodes with battery-capacitive storage features, which show high reversible capacity, good rate capability and long cycling performance as anode and cathode in half-cells (using metallic Li as counter electrode). Moreover, for the first time, we use the HDMPCs both as anode and cathode materials to assemble LIC. The HDMPC{\textbar}{\textbar}HDMPC LIC can deliver integrated high energy density (106.4Whkg−1) and power density (88.8kWkg−1), as well as a superior cycling performance with a capacitance retention of 88.3\% after 8000 cycles at the current density of 2Ag−1.},

By using LiPF6 containing propylene carbonate/diethyl carbonate electrolyte solution, excellent cycle performance can be obtained even at a moderately high temperature, because (1) LiCoO2 remains stable, and (2) non-graphitizable carbon exhibits a good cyclability with respect to Li-doping/undoping capability. Although a thin film is formed on the carbon surface during charge and discharge cycling, the discharge capacity degradation is only 10 to 20\% after 500 cycles. Furthermore, even if the cell is overcharged, safety can be attained (1) by providing an anti-overcharging safety device which operates when Li2CO3 in the cathode is decomposed and (2) by using a polyolefin separator which shuts down at a high temperature due to overcharge current.},

A cross-linked comb-copolymer, consisting of ethylene oxide (EO), 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl glycidyl ether (MEEGE), and allyl glycidyl ether (AGE), was used as a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE). LiCoO2 composite cathodes were fabricated using binder comb-copolymers, consisting of EO and MEEGE with different compositions. Ionic conductivity of the SPE, and the interfacial charge transfer processes between the SPE and metallic lithium and between the SPE and the composite cathode at several cathode potentials versus Li/Li+, were electrochemically explored. With increasing MEEGE composition in the binder copolymers, the interfacial resistances between the SPE and the composite cathode appreciably decreased. As the result, discharge capacity of the LPB also enhanced with increasing the MEEGE composition. The introduction of the branched-side-chains to the polymer backbone to the binder polymers for the composite cathodes caused to facilitate the interfacial charge transport processes, while the introduction had also been found to be very effective in terms of the enhancement of ionic conductivity of SPE.},

	abstract = {Recently, aluminum ion batteries (AIBs) have attracted great attention across the globe by virtue of its massive gravimetric and volumetric capacities in addition to its high abundance. Though carbon derivatives are excellent cathodes for AIBs, there is much room for further development. In this study, flexuous graphite (FG) was synthesized by a simple thermal shock treatment and, for the first time, an Al/FG battery was applied as a cathode for AIBs to reveal the real-time intercalation of AlCl4- into FG with high flexibility using in situ scanning electron microscope (SEM) measurements exclusively. Similarly, in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and in situ Raman techniques have been used to understand the anomalous electrochemical behavior of FG. It was found that FG adopts a unique integrated intercalation–adsorption mechanism where it follows an intercalation mechanism potential above 1.5 V and an adsorption mechanism potential below 1.5 V. This unique integrated intercalation–adsorption mechanism allows FG to exhibit superior properties, like high capacity (≥140 mAh/g), remarkable long-term stability (over 8000 cycles), excellent rate retention (93 mAh/g at 7.5 A/g) and extremely rapid charging and slow discharging.},

The pollutant removal capacity of this B2O3/CN (B-CN) was studied by a powder suspension experiment and added into concrete to evaluate the adsorption and degradation of methylene blue (MB). The characterizations of all samples indicate that B2O3 significantly affects CN, e.g., by increasing the CN specific surface area to 3.6 times the original value, extending visible light adsorption, and narrowing the band gap from 2.56 eV to 2.42 eV. Furthermore, the results show that B-CN composite materials have a higher MB-removal efficiency, with the adsorption capacity reaching 43.11 mg/g, which is about 3.3 times that of pristine CN. The MB adsorption process on B2-CN is mainly via electrostatic attraction and \&pi;\&ndash;\&pi; interactions. In addition, B-CN added into concrete also has good performance. After five adsorption\&ndash;degradation cycles, B-CN and photocatalytic concrete still exhibit a good regenerate ability and excellent stability, which are very important for practical applications.},

We have discovered that cyclic mechanical stresses cause significant degradation in the binder electrical conductivity. After just 160 mechanical cycles, the conductivity of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF):carbon black binder dropped between 45–75\%. This degradation in binder conductivity has been shown to be quite general, occurring over a range of carbon black concentrations, with and without absorbed electrolyte solvent and for different polymer manufacturers. Mechanical cycling of lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) cathodes caused a similar degradation, reducing the effective electrical conductivity by 30–40\%. Mesoscale simulations on a reconstructed experimental cathode geometry predicted the binder conductivity degradation will have a proportional impact on cathode electrical conductivity, in qualitative agreement with the experimental measurements. Finally, ohmic resistance measurements were made on complete batteries. Direct comparisons between electrochemical cycling and mechanical cycling show consistent trends in the conductivity decline. This evidence supports a new mechanism for performance decline of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries during operation – electrochemically-induced mechanical stresses that degrade binder conductivity, increasing the internal resistance of the battery with cycling.},

The chemistry of the samples is characterized using elemental analysis, Boehm titration, potentiometric titration, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Sorption of nitrogen and carbon dioxide is used to determine the textural properties. The results show that the surface chemistry is affected by the type of nitrogen precursor and the specific groups present on the surface before the treatment leading to the incorporation of nitrogen. Analysis of the electrochemical behavior of urea- and melamine-treated samples reveal pseudocapacitance from both the oxygen and the nitrogen containing functional groups located in the pores larger than 10 Å. On the other hand, pores between 5 Å and 6 Å are most effective in a double-layer formation, which correlates well with the size of hydrated ions. Although the quaternary and pyridinic-N-oxides nitrogen groups have enhancing effects on capacitance due to the positive charge, and thus an improved electron transfer at high current loads, the most important functional groups affecting energy storage performance are pyrrolic and pyridinic nitrogen along with quinone oxygen.},

	abstract = {In this work, human hair was firstly used to prepared heteroatom-doped carbon materials. Tunable N-doped or dual N, S-doped microporous carbons were successful prepared using glucose and human hair as carbon precursors via a method of hydrothermal carbonization procedure and sequent KOH activation. The electrochemical capacitive performance of the prepared carbons was investigated in KOH electrolyte. The morphology, structure and surface properties of the carbon materials are investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), N2 adsorption, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The N- or S-doping could be tuned by controlling the dosage of human hair additives. Due to the synergistic effect of multi N, O, S-doped species, the prepared carbons showed large pseudo-capacitance. The capacitance of AHC-4 could reach 264Fg−1 in KOH electrolyte. AHC-1 shows an acceptable cycle life with relatively high capacitance value of 154Fg−1 after 1000 cycles. The present preparation method is attractive and inspiring for preparation of tunable dual heteroatom-doped carbon materials with high surface area and capacitive performance using renewable biomass.},

Compared to conventional bulk hBN microparticles, exfoliated hBN nanoplatelets improve the mechanical properties of gel electrolytes by 2 orders of magnitude (shear storage modulus ∼5 MPa), while retaining high ionic conductivity at room temperature ({\textgreater}1 mS cm–1). Moreover, exfoliated hBN nanoplatelets are compatible with high-voltage cathodes ({\textgreater}5 V vs Li/Li+) and impart exceptional thermal stability that allows high-rate operation of solid-state rechargeable lithium-ion batteries at temperatures up to 175 °C.},

Initial overheating of the cell is one of the factors responsible for the failure of LIB safety, which is caused by short circuit under high temperature and high current environment. As separator is the main component to prevent short circuit, thermal stability of the separator is crucial in this regard. In this study, boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) are synthesized and used for the first time as a new type of high performance inorganic nanomaterials to prevent short-circuit. We provide a new configuration strategy for the modification of conventional polyolefin separator by simply incorporation of appropriately engineered long and fine BNNTs without blocking the porous channels of the conventional separator for Li+ ion diffusion. This new BNNT separator exhibits improved thermal stability up to 150 °C, ensuring the safe operation of LIB cells at elevated temperatures. The high rate capability of the cell with BNNT separator is also improved dramatically due to absorb extra heat and spread it through BNNTs during the cycling process. The BNNTs demonstrate an exciting new nanomaterials in improving thermal stability of the polyolefin separator by protecting thermal shrinkage at high temperature and high current operation, which eventually prevent battery short-circuit.},

	abstract = {Structured Abstract
Background The integration of graphene in photovoltaic modules, fuel cells, batteries, supercapacitors, and devices for hydrogen generation offers opportunities to tackle challenges driven by the increasing global energy demand. Graphene’s two-dimensional (2D) nature leads to a theoretical surface-to-mass ratio of {\textasciitilde}2600 m2/g, which combined with its high electrical conductivity and flexibility, gives it the potential to store electric charge, ions, or hydrogen. Other 2D crystals, such as transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs) and transition metal oxides, are also promising and are now gaining increasing attention for energy applications. The advantage of using such 2D crystals is linked to the possibility of creating and designing layered artificial structures with “on-demand” properties by means of spin-on processes, or layer-by-layer assembly. This approach exploits the availability of materials with metallic, semiconducting, and insulating properties.
Advances The success of graphene and related materials (GRMs) for energy applications crucially depends on the development and optimization of production methods. High-volume liquid-phase exfoliation is being developed for a wide variety of layered materials. This technique is being optimized to control the flake size and to increase the edge-to-surface ratio, which is crucial for optimizing electrode performance in fuel cells and batteries. Micro- or nanocrystal or flake edge control can also be achieved through chemical synthesis. This is an ideal route for functionalization, in order to improve storage capacity. Large-area growth via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been demonstrated, producing material with high structural and electronic quality for the preparation of transparent conducting electrodes for displays and touch-screens, and is being evaluated for photovoltaic applications. CVD growth of other multicomponent layered materials is less mature and needs further development. Although many transfer techniques have been developed successfully, further improvement of high-volume manufacturing and transfer processes for multilayered heterostructures is needed. In this context, layer-by-layer assembly may enable the realization of devices with on-demand properties for targeted applications, such as photovoltaic devices in which photon absorption in TMDs is combined with charge transport in graphene.
Outlook Substantial progress has been made on the preparation of GRMs at the laboratory level. However, cost-effective production of GRMs on an industrial scale is needed to create the future energy value chain. Applications that could benefit the most from GRMs include flexible electronics, batteries with efficient anodes and cathodes, supercapacitors with high energy density, and solar cells. The realization of GRMs with specific transport and insulating properties on demand is an important goal. Additional energy applications of GRMs comprise water splitting and hydrogen production. As an example, the edges of MoS2 single layers can oxidize fuels—such as hydrogen, methanol, and ethanol—in fuel cells, and GRM membranes can be used in fuel cells to improve proton exchange. Functionalized graphene can be exploited for water splitting and hydrogen production. Flexible and wearable devices and membranes incorporating GRMs can also generate electricity from motion, as well as from water and gas flows. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/347/6217/1246501/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Tailored GRMs for energy applications. The ability to produce GRMs with desired specific properties paves the way to their integration in a variety of energy devices. Solution processing and chemical vapor deposition are the ideal means to produce thin films that can be used as electrodes in energy devices (such as solar panels, batteries, fuel cells, or in hydrogen storage). Chemical synthesis is an attractive route to produce “active” elements in solar cell or thermoelectric devices.
Graphene and related two-dimensional crystals and hybrid systems showcase several key properties that can address emerging energy needs, in particular for the ever growing market of portable and wearable energy conversion and storage devices. Graphene’s flexibility, large surface area, and chemical stability, combined with its excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, make it promising as a catalyst in fuel and dye-sensitized solar cells. Chemically functionalized graphene can also improve storage and diffusion of ionic species and electric charge in batteries and supercapacitors. Two-dimensional crystals provide optoelectronic and photocatalytic properties complementing those of graphene, enabling the realization of ultrathin-film photovoltaic devices or systems for hydrogen production. Here, we review the use of graphene and related materials for energy conversion and storage, outlining the roadmap for future applications.
Layered materials power the cause
Methods for storing and converting energy, including fuel cells, solar cells, and water splitting, often benefit from having materials with a large surface area. When combined with a high surface reactivity, high conductivity, or useful optical properties, two-dimensional layered materials become of notable interest for a range of applications. Bonaccorso et al. review the progress that has been made using graphene and other layered or two-dimensional materials at laboratory scales and the challenges in producing these materials in industrially relevant quantities.

	abstract = {Lithium manganese oxides with a two-dimensional layered crystal structure are of high fundamental and technological interest as cathode materials for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, due to the safety, low cost, and low toxicity of manganese-based materials. However, basic problems such as the collapse of the layer structure during cycling of the battery have proven difficult to solve. This collapse usually leads to poor rate performance and to evolution of steps in the voltage profile, both of which are undesirable for practical applications. This article highlights important recent work on stabilization of the layered crystal structure of lithium manganese oxide. In particular we focus on the use of layered manganese oxide as a base for developing novel complex solid–solution cathode materials with improved capacity, cycling stability, and safety.},

	abstract = {Graphene has been widely used as conformal nanobuilding blocks to improve the electrochemical performance of layered metal sulfides (MoS2, WS2, SnS, and SnS2) as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries. However, it still lacks in-depth understanding of the synergistic effect between these layered sulfides and graphene, which contributes to the enhanced electroactivity for sodium-ion batteries. Here, MoS2/reduced graphene oxide (RGO) nanocomposites with intimate two-dimensional heterointerfaces are prepared by a facile one-pot hydrothermal method. The heterointerfacial area can be effectively tuned by changing the ratio of MoS2 to RGO. When used as anode materials for sodium-ion batteries, the synergistic effect contributing to the enhanced reversible capacity of MoS2/RGO nanocomposites is closely related with the heterointerfacial area. The computational results demonstrate that Na prefers to be adsorbed on MoS2 in the MoS2/RGO heterostructure rather than intercalate into the MoS2/RGO heterointerface. Interestingly, the MoS2/RGO heterointerfaces can significantly increase the electronic conductivity of MoS2, store more Na ions, while maintaining the high diffusion mobility of Na atoms on MoS2 surface and high electron transfer efficiency from Na to MoS2. It is expected that the efforts to establish the correlation between the two-dimensional heterointerface and the electrochemical sodium-ion storage performance offer fundamental understanding for the rational design of layered metal sulfides/graphene composites as high-performance electrode materials for sodium-ion batteries.},

The nanocomposite acts as a high capacity anode material for lithium-ion batteries and exhibits good cyclic behavior. Its initial capacity exceeds the theoretical capacity of 745 mA h g−1 in a mixture of MoO3 and graphite (1 : 1 by weight), and the stable capacity of 700 mA h g−1 (94\% of the theoretical capacity) is still retained after 120 cycles. The electrode performance is linked with the unique nanoarchitecture of the composite and is compared with the performance of MoO3-based anode materials reported in the literature previously (nanoparticles, ball milled powders, and carbon-coated nanobelts). The high value of capacity and good cyclic stability of MoO3–carbon nanocomposite are attractive in respect to those of the reported MoO3 electrodes.},

The Li binding energies and diffusion barriers are comparable in MoO3 bulk and double-layer. Reducing the dimension to the MoO3 monolayer simultaneously lowers the Li diffusion barrier and the interaction between Li atoms and the MoO3 monolayer. Cutting the MoO3 monolayer into 1D nanoribbons can further facilitate the diffusion of Li atoms, and enhance the Li binding energies. Especially, Li diffusion on nanoribbons is rather facile along both the axial and the transverse directions. These computational results demonstrate that due to the dimensional reduction, MoO3 monolayer nanosheets and nanoribbons have exceptional properties (good electronic conductivity, fast Li diffusion, high operating voltage and high energy density), and thus are promising as high-rate Li ion battery electrodes.},

Its open-framework structure allows retention of 66\% of the initial capacity even at a very high (41.7C) rate. At low current densities, its round trip energy efficiency reaches 99\%.

	abstract = {Structured Abstract
Background The integration of graphene in photovoltaic modules, fuel cells, batteries, supercapacitors, and devices for hydrogen generation offers opportunities to tackle challenges driven by the increasing global energy demand. Graphene’s two-dimensional (2D) nature leads to a theoretical surface-to-mass ratio of {\textasciitilde}2600 m2/g, which combined with its high electrical conductivity and flexibility, gives it the potential to store electric charge, ions, or hydrogen. Other 2D crystals, such as transition metal chalcogenides (TMDs) and transition metal oxides, are also promising and are now gaining increasing attention for energy applications. The advantage of using such 2D crystals is linked to the possibility of creating and designing layered artificial structures with “on-demand” properties by means of spin-on processes, or layer-by-layer assembly. This approach exploits the availability of materials with metallic, semiconducting, and insulating properties.
Advances The success of graphene and related materials (GRMs) for energy applications crucially depends on the development and optimization of production methods. High-volume liquid-phase exfoliation is being developed for a wide variety of layered materials. This technique is being optimized to control the flake size and to increase the edge-to-surface ratio, which is crucial for optimizing electrode performance in fuel cells and batteries. Micro- or nanocrystal or flake edge control can also be achieved through chemical synthesis. This is an ideal route for functionalization, in order to improve storage capacity. Large-area growth via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been demonstrated, producing material with high structural and electronic quality for the preparation of transparent conducting electrodes for displays and touch-screens, and is being evaluated for photovoltaic applications. CVD growth of other multicomponent layered materials is less mature and needs further development. Although many transfer techniques have been developed successfully, further improvement of high-volume manufacturing and transfer processes for multilayered heterostructures is needed. In this context, layer-by-layer assembly may enable the realization of devices with on-demand properties for targeted applications, such as photovoltaic devices in which photon absorption in TMDs is combined with charge transport in graphene.
Outlook Substantial progress has been made on the preparation of GRMs at the laboratory level. However, cost-effective production of GRMs on an industrial scale is needed to create the future energy value chain. Applications that could benefit the most from GRMs include flexible electronics, batteries with efficient anodes and cathodes, supercapacitors with high energy density, and solar cells. The realization of GRMs with specific transport and insulating properties on demand is an important goal. Additional energy applications of GRMs comprise water splitting and hydrogen production. As an example, the edges of MoS2 single layers can oxidize fuels—such as hydrogen, methanol, and ethanol—in fuel cells, and GRM membranes can be used in fuel cells to improve proton exchange. Functionalized graphene can be exploited for water splitting and hydrogen production. Flexible and wearable devices and membranes incorporating GRMs can also generate electricity from motion, as well as from water and gas flows. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/347/6217/1246501/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Tailored GRMs for energy applications. The ability to produce GRMs with desired specific properties paves the way to their integration in a variety of energy devices. Solution processing and chemical vapor deposition are the ideal means to produce thin films that can be used as electrodes in energy devices (such as solar panels, batteries, fuel cells, or in hydrogen storage). Chemical synthesis is an attractive route to produce “active” elements in solar cell or thermoelectric devices.
Graphene and related two-dimensional crystals and hybrid systems showcase several key properties that can address emerging energy needs, in particular for the ever growing market of portable and wearable energy conversion and storage devices. Graphene’s flexibility, large surface area, and chemical stability, combined with its excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, make it promising as a catalyst in fuel and dye-sensitized solar cells. Chemically functionalized graphene can also improve storage and diffusion of ionic species and electric charge in batteries and supercapacitors. Two-dimensional crystals provide optoelectronic and photocatalytic properties complementing those of graphene, enabling the realization of ultrathin-film photovoltaic devices or systems for hydrogen production. Here, we review the use of graphene and related materials for energy conversion and storage, outlining the roadmap for future applications.
Layered materials power the cause
Methods for storing and converting energy, including fuel cells, solar cells, and water splitting, often benefit from having materials with a large surface area. When combined with a high surface reactivity, high conductivity, or useful optical properties, two-dimensional layered materials become of notable interest for a range of applications. Bonaccorso et al. review the progress that has been made using graphene and other layered or two-dimensional materials at laboratory scales and the challenges in producing these materials in industrially relevant quantities.

The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas for five NPC samples obtained by carbonizing at the temperatures from 530 to 1000°C fall into the range from 1140 to 3040m2g−1 and the dependence of BET surface areas on carbonization temperatures shows a “V” shape. All the five NPC samples have a pore size distribution centered at about 3.9nm. As electrode materials for supercapacitor, the NPC samples obtained at the temperatures higher than 600°C display the ideal capacitor behaviors and give rise to almost constant specific capacitance (above 100Fg−1 at 5mVs−1) at various sweep rates, which is associated with their mesoporous characteristics. However, the NPC sample with the highest BET surface area (3040m2g−1) obtained by carbonizing at 530°C gives a unusually low capacitance (12Fg−1 at 5mVs−1), which may be attributed to the poor conductivity of the carbon material due to the low carbonization temperature.},

The obtained samples have been systematically characterized by XRD, SEM, TEM and N2 adsorption-desorption analysis. The results show that the Fe2O 3@NiCo2O4 porous nanocages have an average diameter of 213 nm and a shell thickness of about 30 nm. As anode materials for Li-ion batteries, the Fe2O3@NiCo2O4 porous nanocages exhibit a high initial discharge capacity of 1311.4 mA h g -1 at a current density of 100 mA g-1 (about 0.1 C). The capacity is retained at 1079.6 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles. The synergistic effect of the different components and the porous hollow structure contributes to the outstanding performance of the composite electrode.

However, the pyridinic nitrogen is also responsible for the instability of the material. We also present experimental results on the charge and discharge capacities of C6N8.

The redox reactions of PB and PBAs are believed to be very fast and reversible. However, it is not always true. In this paper, we clarify the detailed redox behavior of PB in an electrolyte for Li (ion) batteries using an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance under an Ar atmosphere. We quantitatively report for the first time that the electrochemical adsorption/desorption of PF6− ions occurs in addition to the insertion/extraction of Li+ ions upon the redox reactions of PB. The adsorption of PF6− ions is followed by the extraction of Li+ ions during the oxidation of PB, and the adsorbed PF6− ions hinder the extraction of the Li+ ions. In contrast, the adsorbed PF6− ions do not affect Li+ ion insertion because the PF6− ions are desorbed before the insertion of Li+ ions during the reduction of PB. These results show that for practical applications the size of the framework structure should be selected by comparing the anion size in addition to the cation size.},

Herein, we demonstrate that nanoparticles of cobalt hexacyanocobaltate and manganese hexacyanocobaltate, typical Prussian blue analogues with the chemical formula M3II[CoIII(CN)6]2·nH2O (M = Co, Mn), can be operated as novel battery anodes in an organic liquid-carbonate electrolyte. The Co3[Co(CN)6]2 material exhibits a clear electrochemical activity in the voltage range of 0.01–3 V vs. Li/Li+ with a reversible capacity of 299.1 mA h g−1. Furthermore, superior rate capability (as the current density increases from 20 to 2000 mA g−1, the capacity retains about 34\%) could be achieved, attributing to the small particle sizes and rapid transport of Li+ ions through large channels in the open-framework. We believe that this work provides a new insight into the electrochemical properties of PBAs and opens new perspectives to develop anode materials for rechargeable batteries.},

	abstract = {SnS2 is a two-dimensional (2D) layered transition metal dichalcogenide that has been extensively investigated as an anode for lithium ion batteries (LIBs). However, it generally undergoes a large volume change during cycling, resulting in severe capacity loss. Composites of SnS2 with carbon-based nanomaterials could deliver improved cyclic stability and rate performance. However, there is considerable room for performance improvement. In the present work, highly interdigitated porous nano-architectures of ternary composites consisting of 2D nanomaterials of SnS2, reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) were synthesized via a simple one-pot hydrothermal route. The synthesized ternary nanocomposites were characterized with high surface area, porous structure, and high pore volume. Due to the intimate face-to-face interactions offered by the 2D structured constituents, the obtained nanocomposites showed remarkably improved performances as anodes in LIBs. In particular, the galvanostatic charge–discharge performance depends on the amount of g-C3N4 in the nanocomposites. The composite containing 6.6 wt\% g-C3N4 showed the best performance, attaining a specific capacity of 1248.4 mA h g−1 after 276 cycles with a coulombic efficiency of 99.9\% at 100 mA g−1 along with an excellent rate performance. The outstanding performances of the composite anodes were attributed to the unique 3D porous structure, low charge transfer resistance, and high lithium ion diffusion coefficient, afforded by the synergistic effect of concurrent encompassing of rGO and g-C3N4 around the SnS2 platelets.},

The physicochemical properties such as swelling ratio, ion exchange capacity, proton conductivity, vanadium ion permeability, etc. change with the content of g-C3N4 nanosheets. SPEEK/g-C3N4-1.5 hybrid membrane exhibits a higher coulombic efficiency (CE: 97\%) and energy efficiency (EE: 83.6\%) at 30 mA cm-2, as compared with Nafion 117 (CE: 90\% and EE: 73.8\%) and SPEEK membrane (CE: 89.9\% and EE: 76.1\%). The self-discharge time of VRB with SPEEK/g-C3N4-1.5 (68 h) is longer than that of Nafion 117 membrane (26 h). A good structure stability against strong oxidizing and acid condition is proved under 300 charge-discharge cycles. The formed acid-base pairs between -NH2 groups of g-C3N4 and sulfonic acid groups of SPEEK contribute the comprehensive properties of vanadium ion permeability and its selectivity, accompanied with an enhanced proton transport channel. These SPEEK/g-C3N4 hybrid membranes provide the acceptable candidate for VRB application because of their high structure stability and ion selectivity.},

	abstract = {A novel oxidized g-C3N4 (OCN)-modified Sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK) composite membrane were fabricated via a solution-casting method. The physicochemical properties of composite membranes with different oxidized-C3N4 content were characterized, including water uptake, swelling ratio, ion exchange capacity, proton conductivity, vanadium ion permeability and ion selectivity. It was found that when the content of OCN incorporated into SPEEK matrix was 1\%, this composite membrane showed a low vanadium ion permeability(9.09×10−7cm2min−1) and high ion selectivity(6.60×104Smincm−3). The vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) assembled with this membrane at 60mAcm−2 exhibited a higher coulombic efficiency (98\%) than Nafion 117 membrane (95\%). Moreover, in cycling tests VRB assembled with this composite membrane showed a more stable cycle performance compared with that of Nafion 117 membrane. Thus, the OCN-modified SPEEK composite membrane has a potential application for VRB system.},

	abstract = {Uniform α-MoO3 nanorods are synthesized with controlled aspect ratios through a fast hydrothermal route. The control over the aspect ratio of these as-prepared nanorods is realized by applying different reaction times of 2−20 h. Specifically, the nanorods prepared with a reaction time of 2 h are, on average, much shorter in length and slightly smaller in width compared with those obtained with a longer reaction time of 20 h. The products are thoroughly characterized by FESEM/TEM/XRD/BET techniques. The electrochemical properties of the samples are analyzed using cyclic voltammetry and charge−discharge cycling. These studies reveal that the as-prepared nanorods with a smaller aspect ratio exhibit a higher initial discharge capacity, a lower irreversible loss, and better rate behavior at different charge−discharge rates. When compared to α-MoO3 submicrometer particles prepared through direct thermal decomposition, these as-prepared nanorods show much better lihtium storage properties, demonstrating that enhanced physical and/or chemical properties can be obained from proper nanostructuring of the material.},

We present a hexagonal structure of MoO3 microrods as an Al-ion intercalation host material and show its first-time use as a potential electrode for an aqueous Al-ion battery system.

However, the development of electrodes and non-aqueous electrolyte solutions for aluminum batteries is still a great challenge. Layered-type molybdite (α-MoO3) is studied here as a positive electrode for Al metal battery and ionic liquid is used as electrolyte solution. The observed maximum gravimetric capacity is 100 mAh g−1, although only a few discharge-charge cycles were successfully carried out and the capacity falls quickly. According to electrochemical, XRD, NMR, microanalysis and XPS results, aluminum cation is intercalated in the interlayer space (van der Waals gap) between the octahedron layers (MoO6) while the main framework is preserved. Because of the intercalation of aluminum and the reduction of molybdenum, the interlayer spacing of AlxMoO3 is reversibly increased compared to pristine molybdite. The intercalation of aluminum into molybdite is a slow process and rather limited to the region near the surface of the particles.},

Two different 2D materials, titanium carbide MXene (Ti3C2Tx) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), have shown promising results for supercapacitor applications due to their flake-like morphology, high conductivity; and ability to intercalate molecules or ions for charge storage. Here, we demonstrate the self-assembly of a heterostructure between negatively charged Ti3C2Tx and positively charged modified rGO after shear mixing. Changes in zeta (ζ) potential, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns; and Raman spectra confirm the assembly of this heterostructure. The produced rGO : Ti3C2Tx heterostructures were used as electrodes for supercapacitors. The addition of rGO to Ti3C2Tx allowed some widening of the voltage window. Moreover, due to the synergistic effect of these materials, an increase of the capacitance value was observed. An electrode film composed of rGO (1 wt.\%) and Ti3C2Tx (99 wt.\%) achieved capacitance values up to 254 F ⋅ g−1 at 2 mV ⋅ s−1 and 193 F ⋅ g−1 at 100 mV ⋅ s−1.},

Electrospinning, an electrostatic fiber fabrication technique has evinced more interest and attention in recent years due to its versatility and potential for applications in diverse fields. The notable applications include in tissue engineering, biosensors, filtration, wound dressings, drug delivery, and enzyme immobilization. The nanoscale fibers are generated by the application of strong electric field on polymer solution or melt. The non-wovens nanofibrous mats produced by this technique mimics extracellular matrix components much closely as compared to the conventional techniques. The sub-micron range spun fibers produced by this process, offer various advantages like high surface area to volume ratio, tunable porosity and the ability to manipulate nanofiber composition in order to get desired properties and function. Over the years, more than 200 polymers have been electropun for various applications and the number is still increasing gradually with time. With these in perspectives, we aim to present in this review, an overview of the electrospinning technique with its promising advantages and potential applications. We have discussed the electrospinning theory, spinnable polymers, parameters (solution and processing), which significantly affect the fiber morphology, solvent properties and melt electrospinning (alternative to solution electrospinning). Finally, we have focused on varied applications of electrospun fibers in different fields and concluded with the future prospects of this efficient technology.},

	abstract = {Commercial lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries built with Ni- and Co-based intercalation-type cathodes suffer from low specific energy, high toxicity and high cost. A further increase in the energy storage characteristics of such cells is challenging because capacities of such intercalation compounds approach their theoretical values and a further increase in their maximum voltage induces serious safety concerns. The growing market for portable energy storage is undergoing a rapid expansion as new applications demand lighter, smaller, safer and lower cost batteries to enable broader use of plug-in hybrid and pure-electric vehicles (PHEVs and EVs), drones and renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind. Conversion-type cathode materials are some of the key candidates for the next-generation of rechargeable Li and Li-ion batteries. Continuous rapid progress in performance improvements of such cathodes is essential to utilize them in future applications. In this review we consider price, abundance and safety of the elements in the periodic table for their use in conversion cathodes. We further compare specific and volumetric capacities of a broad range of conversion materials. By offering a model for practically achievable volumetric energy density and specific energy of Li cells with graphite, silicon (Si) and lithium (Li) anodes, we observe the impact of cathode chemistry directly. This allows us to estimate potentials of different conversion cathodes for exceeding the energy characteristics of cells built with state of the art intercalation compounds. We additionally review the key challenges faced when using conversion-type active materials in cells and general strategies to overcome them. Finally, we discuss future trends and perspectives for cost reduction and performance enhancement.},

There are still notable challenges in the development of next-generation Li-ion batteries. New battery concepts have to be further developed to go beyond Li-ion batteries in the future. In this tutorial review, the focus is to introduce the basic concepts, highlight the recent progress, and discuss the challenges regarding Li-ion batteries. Brief discussion on popularly studied “beyond Li-ion” batteries is also provided.},

Excellent cycling stability is also observed at an even higher charge–discharge rate. A high reversible capacity of 149 mAh g–1 also can be obtained at a current rate of 500 mA g–1 (2C). The good Na-ion insertion property is attributed to the short diffusion distance in the HCNWs and the large interlayer distance (0.37 nm) between the graphitic sheets, which agrees with the interlayered distance predicted by theoretical calculations to enable Na-ion insertion in carbon materials.},

	abstract = {Nonaqueous aluminum-ion batteries are an interesting emerging energy storage technology, offering a plethora of advantages over existing grid energy storage solutions. Carbonaceous and graphitic materials are an appealing cathode material in this system, thanks to their low cost and excellent rate capabilities. The phenomenon of poor Coulombic efficiency in the first cycle, however, is a known issue among some types of carbons, the reasons for which are yet to be fully understood. In this work, we propose that such processes are caused by the formation of a solid-electrolyte interphase, in a similar fashion to graphite anodes in lithium-ion batteries. Using electrospun carbon nanofibers as a model material with tunable crystallinity, the cause of such phenomena was found to be linked to the presence of surface defects in the cathode material, and was further amplified by high surface area. The simple use of a binder polymer, however, helps mitigating the issue by shielding surface defects from direct contact with the electrolyte.},

The structural analysis was clearly illustrated that the prepared BN nanosheets were supported on the graphene layer. It is confirmed that the G/BN-20\% content shown round leaf-like morphology and particle size approximately 100?nm. Further, the electroanalytical performance of G/BN materials was measured by galvanostatic charge/discharge, cyclic voltammetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies. It was observed that the G/BN-20\% material was exhibited with a good discharge capacity (105?mAh?g?1) at the current density of 25?mA?g?1, which is higher capacity retention and rate capability at around 100 cycles. Due to the exceptional magnesium storage behaviour of G/BN-20\% material which is used as a cathode, has shown a strong synergistic effect.},

	abstract = {Aluminium batteries with non-aqueous electrolyte have initially focused on Lewis acidic ionic liquid systems with heavy Al2Cl7 − anions that limit the specific capacity, energy and power. In order to develop the secondary aluminium batteries further for future energy storage beyond lithium-ion, high performance electrolytes that enable efficient aluminium deposition/dissolution must be developed. This work studied the electrodeposition of aluminium from both 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride aluminium chloride (EMImCl-AlCl3) ionic liquids with different Lewis acidities, and their gel form- the ionogel. Thereby, cyclic voltammetry, in-operando atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray diffraction measurements were used to determine the characteristics of aluminium deposition in the ionic liquid depending on the ratio of AlCl3 to EMImCl. Based on these insights, Lewis acidic and neutral ionic liquids were gelified with polyethylene oxide. The focus was on the feasibility of aluminium deposition in Lewis neutral ionogels containing only lightweight AlCl4 − anions. It was proven for the first time that aluminium can be deposited from a Lewis neutral ionogel without any dendrite growth within a very wide potential stability window of 5 V but at a low coulombic efficiency of ≤60\%.},
