  abstract = {A 3D porous composite consisting of nano-0D MoS2, nano-1D carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and nano-2D graphene is successful prepared using an electrostatic spray deposition (ESD) technique. Depending on the preparation procedure either nanodots of amorphous MoS2 (0.5\textendash{}5 nm) or nanocrystalline few-layered MoS2 (5\textendash{}10 nm) bonded to graphene-carbon nanotubes backbone are obtained. These functionalized carbon nanotubes adhere to a porous graphene-based network. Such composites can be directly \-deposited on the current collectors without any binder or conductive additives to assemble a battery that shows superior rate performance and cycling \-stability. For nanodots, nucleation and diffusion issues usually connected with \-conversion are largely mitigated if not totally nullified. The use of mechanically and diffusionally isolated but electrochemically well connected electroactive nanodots offer an effective solution to render conversion reaction reversible. The use of nano-1D and nano-2D carbon structures offer additional electrical and mechanical advantages that are discussed. Furthermore, this technique, which is easily extendable to other electrode materials, seems to be of a great potential, especially for thin-film batteries, flexible batteries, and future \-paintable batteries.},

The tin exists in the alloys as a second phase, typically as {$\sim$}1 {$\mu$}m inclusions (precipitates) distributed throughout the aluminium structure, and anodic dissolution occurs to form pits around the tin inclusions. Although the distribution of the gallium in the alloy could not be established, it is also shown to be critical in the formation of these pits as well as maintaining their activity. The stability of the alloys to open circuit corrosion and the overpotential for high rate dissolution, both critical to battery performance, are shown to depend on factors in addition to elemental composition; both heat treatment and mechanical working influence the performance of the alloy. The correlation between alloy performance and their microstructure has been investigated.},

The substitution of lithium with alternative metal anodes characterized by lower cost and higher abundance is nowadays one of the most widely explored paths to reduce the cost of electrochemical storage systems and enable long-term sustainability. Aluminum based secondary batteries could be a viable alternative to the present Li-ion technology because of their high volumetric capacity (8040 mAh cm-3 for Al vs 2046 mAh cm-3 for Li). Additionally, the low cost aluminum makes these batteries appealing for large-scale electrical energy storage. Here, we describe the evolution of the various aluminum systems, starting from those based on aqueous electrolytes to, in more details, those based on non-aqueous electrolytes. Particular attention has been dedicated to the latest development of electrolytic media characterized by low reactivity towards other cell components. The attention is then focused on electrode materials enabling the reversible aluminum intercalation-deintercalation process. Finally, we touch on the topic of high-capacity aluminum-sulfur batteries, attempting to forecast their chances to reach the status of practical energy storage systems.},

Three different mixing procedures were used, (i) magnetic stirring, (ii) magnetic stirring with additional sonication steps and (iii) ball milling. SEM studies allow to determine that the mixing procedure has a significant effect in the microstructure of the active material. Indeed, ball milling was found to destroy the pristine MCMB microstructure and to induce agglomeration in nanosized Co3O4. While magnetic stirring is much less aggressive to that respect, sonication steps were found to enhance the homogeneity of the mixture without inducing major modifications in the microstructure of the materials and hence to have a beneficial impact in the final electrochemical performance.},

A map for pseudocapacitor electrodes is provided, depending on the demands of high conductivity and a remarkable peak of density of states (DOS) in the range of the electrolyte window. The calculated DOS suggests that most of the T phase structures are superior to H phase in electroconductibility. The charge storage capability is represented by the number of gaining or losing electrons calculated by integrating DOS in the electrolyte window. MS2 (M = Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Nb, Mo, Tc) of the T phase is conductive and gains electrons easily with considerable valence state change of the TM atom, showing a redox pseudocapacitance character as a cathode. Meanwhile, CoS2\textendash{}H and MoSe2\textendash{}T are promising anode materials. Moreover, the chalcogen (S, Se, Te) with different electronegativity and work function will result in the changes of Fermi level and surface polarization of MoX2, leading to the shift of their DOS in the electrolyte window. In another way, the metallic hydrogenated H phase of MoS2 (MoS2H2) with conductivity should have enhanced advanced electrochemical performance.},

Aluminum can be alloyed with other active metal elements such as Tin (Sn), Indium (In), Gallium (Ga) and Zinc (Zn). Its binary and tertiary alloys demonstrate improved battery performance. Bifunctional air cathodes fabricated using oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts, CoO/N-CNT with oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, Ni\textendash{}Fe-layered double hydroxide/CNT and MnO2/N-CNT yield excellent results. With regard to electrolytes, several types have been considered: aqueous, non-aqueous, aprotic solvent and solid-state electrolytes. The addition of corrosion inhibitors to an aqueous electrolyte helps to enhance battery performance, whereas non-aqueous and aprotic solvent electrolytes can be used to prevent hydrogen evolution. Polymer electrolytes can overcome the battery leakage problem. As a conclusion, the future research trends related to this type of battery have also been indicated.},

In combination with the binder study, multiple types of carbon with high specific surface area were evaluated as sulfur hosts for high loading sulfur electrodes. A commercial microporous carbon derived from wood with high pore volume showed the best performance. An electrode with sulfur loading up to 10 mg cm-2 was achieved with the optimized recipe. Based on systematic electrochemical studies, the soluble polysulfide to insoluble Li2S2/Li2S conversion was identified to be the major barrier for high loading sulfur electrodes to achieve high sulfur utilization.},

  abstract = {Aluminium-ion batteries are promising electrochemical energy storage systems in replacement of Li-ion batteries owing to the low cost, non-toxicity, safety and three-electron transfer nature of Al-intercalation process. Anatase titanium dioxide has been suggested as a potential anode material for aqueous Al-ion batteries. In this work, TiO2 nanospheres (TiO2-NSs) with highly mesoporous morphology and large specific surface area (179.9 m2 g- 1) were synthesized via hydrolysis of titanium glycolate precursor and subsequent hydrothermal treatment and calcination in an argon atmosphere. The structure and morphology of the prepared TiO2-NSs were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and nitrogen adsorption-desorption. The high surface area TiO2-NSs provide large electrode/electrolyte interface and good electrolyte-holding characteristic, leading to shorten the diffusion path of electrons and ions to the active material, which results in the better high-rate performance. The TiO2-NSs anode exhibited a high initial discharge capacity of 183 mAh g- 1 at a current rate of 0.15 C and a superior rate performance with a capacity of 108 mAh g- 1 even at a discharge current rate of 6.0 C, which are much higher than those of TiO2-P25 electrode.},

Metal sulfides with unique physical and chemical properties, as well as high specific capacity/capacitance, which are typically multiple times higher than that of the carbon/graphite-based materials, are currently studied as promising electrode materials. However, the implementation of these sulfide electrodes in practical applications is hindered by their inferior rate performance and cycling stability. Nanostructures offering the advantages of high surface-to-volume ratios, favourable transport properties, and high freedom for the volume change upon ion insertion/extraction and other reactions, present an opportunity to build next-generation LIBs and SCs. Thus, the development of novel concepts in material research to achieve new nanostructures paves the way for improved electrochemical performance. Herein, we summarize recent advances in nanostructured metal sulfides, such as iron sulfides, copper sulfides, cobalt sulfides, nickel sulfides, manganese sulfides, molybdenum sulfides, tin sulfides, with zero-, one-, two-, and three-dimensional morphologies for LIB and SC applications. In addition, the recently emerged concept of incorporating conductive matrices, especially graphene, with metal sulfide nanomaterials will also be highlighted. Finally, some remarks are made on the challenges and perspectives for the future development of metal sulfide-based LIB and SC devices.},

Theory predicts that many stacked MX2 heterostructures form type II semiconductor heterojunctions that facilitate efficient electron\textendash{}hole separation for light detection and harvesting. Here, we report the first experimental observation of ultrafast charge transfer in photoexcited MoS2/WS2 heterostructures using both photoluminescence mapping and femtosecond pump\textendash{}probe spectroscopy. We show that hole transfer from the MoS2 layer to the WS2 layer takes place within 50 fs after optical excitation, a remarkable rate for van der Waals coupled two-dimensional layers.

  abstract = {High quality and stable electrical contact between metal and two-dimensional materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, is a necessary requirement that has yet to be achieved in order to successfully exploit the advantages that these materials offer to electronics and optoelectronics. MoTe 2 , owing to its phase changing property, can potentially offer a solution. A recent study demonstrated that metallic phase of MoTe 2 connects its semiconducting phase with very low resistance. To utilize this property to connect other two-dimensional materials, it is important to achieve efficient charge transfer between MoTe 2 and other semiconducting materials. Using MoS 2 as an example, we report ultrafast and efficient charge transfer between MoTe 2 and MoS 2 monolayers. In the transient absorption measurements, an ultrashort pump pulse is used to selectively excite electrons in MoTe 2 . The appearance of the excited electrons in the conduction band of MoS 2 is monitored by using a probe pulse that is tuned to the resonance of MoS 2 . We found that electrons transfer to MoS 2 on a time scale of at most 0.3 ps. The transferred electrons give rise to a large transient absorption signal at both A-exciton and B-exciton resonances due to the screening effect. We also observed ultrafast transfer of holes from MoS 2 to MoTe 2 . Our results suggest the feasibility of using MoTe 2 as a bridge material to connect MoS 2 and other transition metal dichalcogenides, and demonstrate a new transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructure involving MoTe 2 , which extends the spectral range of such structures to infrared.},

Cooperation among the different components plays a subtle and important role in determining the physical and electrochemical properties of the electrode. In this study, the physical and electrochemical properties of a LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 cathode were investigated as a function of the electrode compositions. The electrode conductivity, porosity, specific capacity, first Coulombic efficiency, and rate capability were found significantly affected by the polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)-to-acetylene black (AB) ratio and the total inactive material amount. The electronic conductivity of the laminate does not so much decide the rate performance of the electrode as it is generally believed. The rate capability of the electrode is enhanced by an increase in the total inactive material content at a PVDF/AB ratio of 5:4, whereas it is deteriorated by increasing the total inactive material content at PVDF/AB ratios of 5:1 and 5:2. At a PVDF/AB ratio of 5:3, the rate performance is not considerably affected by the inactive material content. The result is explained by the competition between the ion-blocking effect of PVDF binder and the electronic conducting effect of the AB additive. A long-term cycling experiment shows the mechanical integrity of the laminate is important for the durability of the composite electrode.},

  abstract = {Fast ion transport is essential for high rate capability in rechargeable battery operation. Recently, an ultrafast rechargeable aluminum-ion battery was experimentally demonstrated through the reversible intercalation/deintercalation of chloroaluminate anions (AlCl4\textendash{}) in graphitic-foam cathodes. Using first-principles calculations, herein, we report that the unique structural characteristic of graphitic foam, i.e., mechanical flexibility of few-layered graphene nanomaterials, plays a key role for the ultrafast aluminum-ion battery. We found that AlCl4\textendash{} is stored by forming doubly stacked ionic layers in the interlayer space between graphene sheets, and their diffusivity increases dramatically once graphene film is less than five layers thick; the diffusivity begins to increase when the film thickness reduces below five layers in such a way that the film thickness of four, three, and two graphene layers enables 48, 153, and 225 times enhanced diffusivity than that of the bulk graphite, respectively, and this nanoscale thickness is mainly responsible for the observed ultrafast rate capability of graphitic foam. The faster anion conductivity with the reduced film thickness is attributed to high elasticity of few-layered graphene, providing more space for facile AlCl4\textendash{} diffusion. This study indicates that even bulky polyanions can be adopted as carrier ions for ultrahigh rate operation if highly elastic few-layered graphene is used as an active material.},

The stage and atomic structure of the graphite intercalation compounds (GICs) are elucidated, in line with the experimental finding. It is revealed that the intercalants tend to be inserted at relative high densities with a charging potential profile and theoretical specific capacity that agree well with the experiment. Four stable GIC configurations are identified with essentially the same chemical potential for the intercalant, giving rise to charging potential plateaus.

Rechargeable aluminum coin cells fabricated using the as-synthesized binder-free cathode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 239 mAh/g, which is much higher than that of batteries fabricated using a cathode composed of V2O5 nanowires and binder. An obvious discharge voltage plateau appeared at 0.6 V in the discharge curves of the Ni\textendash{}V2O5 cathode, which is slightly higher than that of the V2O5 nanowire cathodes with common binders. This improvement is attributed to reduced electrochemical polarization.},

Alternative electrolytes are strongly needed for further development of rechargeable aluminum batteries, because typical AlCl3-contained imidazole-based ionic liquids are moisture sensitive, corrosive, and with low oxidation voltage. In this letter, a kind of noncorrosive and water-stable ionic liquid obtained by mixing 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate ([BMIM]OTF) with the corresponding aluminum salt (Al(OTF)3) is studied. This ionic liquid electrolyte has a high oxidation voltage (3.25 V vs Al3+/Al) and high ionic conductivity, and a good electrochemical performance is also achieved. A new strategy, which first used corrosive AlCl3-based electrolyte to construct a suitable passageway on the Al anode for Al3+, and then use noncorrosive Al(OTF)3-based electrolyte to get stable Al/electrolyte interface, is put forward.},

Because of this, onion-like carbon can be fabricated into electrodes, used as a conductive additive, and may have potential in composites and additive manufacturing. However due to agglomeration of OLC particles, creating a stable, aqueous dispersion for ink production or formulating composites proves challenging. We explore how attrition milling, acid treatment, and probe sonication can be employed to decrease agglomeration and provide colloidal stability in aqueous media. We also investigate how the electrochemical performance changes with each processing step as well as the treatments in succession. When tested in electrochemical capacitors, the processing increases the capacitance by a factor of three, due to an added pseudocapacitive contribution which is not present in untreated OLC. As a result, the processing of OLC proves to be advantageous for the production of stable, aqueous solutions, which also exhibit improved electrochemical properties suitable for functional inks, conductive additives, and fabrication of composite electrodes.},

For example, the realization of multivalent (MV) batteries, which offer a realistic route to superseding the electrochemical performance of Li-ion batteries, hinges on the discovery of host materials that possess adequate mobility of the MV intercalant to support reasonable charge and discharge times. This has proven especially challenging, motivating the current investigation of ion mobility (Li+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, and Al3+) in spinel Mn2O4, olivine FePO4, layered NiO2, and orthorhombic {$\delta$}-V2O5. In this study, we not only quantitatively assess these structures as candidate cathode materials, but also isolate the chemical and structural descriptors that govern MV diffusion. Our finding that matching the intercalant site preference to the diffusion path topology of the host structure controls mobility more than any other factor leads to practical and implementable guidelines to find fast-diffusing MV ion conductors.},

Rechargeable aluminium-based batteries offer the possibilities of low cost and low flammability, together with three-electron-redox properties leading to high capacity. However, research efforts over the past 30 years have encountered numerous problems, such as cathode material disintegration, low cell discharge voltage (about 0.55 volts; ref. 5), capacitive behaviour without discharge voltage plateaus (1.1\textendash{}0.2 volts or 1.8\textendash{}0.8 volts) and insufficient cycle life (less than 100 cycles) with rapid capacity decay (by 26\textendash{}85 per cent over 100 cycles). Here we present a rechargeable aluminium battery with high-rate capability that uses an aluminium metal anode and a three-dimensional graphitic-foam cathode. The battery operates through the electrochemical deposition and dissolution of aluminium at the anode, and intercalation/de-intercalation of chloroaluminate anions in the graphite, using a non-flammable ionic liquid electrolyte. The cell exhibits well-defined discharge voltage plateaus near 2 volts, a specific capacity of about 70 mA h g\textendash{}1 and a Coulombic efficiency of approximately 98 per cent. The cathode was found to enable fast anion diffusion and intercalation, affording charging times of around one minute with a current density of \textasciitilde{}4,000 mA g\textendash{}1 (equivalent to \textasciitilde{}3,000 W kg\textendash{}1), and to withstand more than 7,500 cycles without capacity decay.},

Additionally, the low cost aluminum makes these batteries appealing for large-scale electrical energy storage. Here, we describe the evolution of the various aluminum systems, starting from those based on aqueous electrolytes to, in more details, those based on non-aqueous electrolytes. Particular attention has been dedicated to the latest development of electrolytic media characterized by low reactivity towards other cell components. The attention is then focused on electrode materials enabling the reversible aluminum intercalation-deintercalation process.

When detrimental surface-related effects such as irreversible capacity loss due to interphase formation (known as solid-electrolyte interphase, SEI) can be mitigated or altogether avoided, the greatest advantage can be achieved by maximizing the gravimetric and volumetric surface area and by tailoring the porosity to accommodate the relevant ion species.

Its ultrahigh surface area and dense, conductive network of homogeneous channels (12 {\AA} in width) render ZTC suitable for the fast, dense storage of AlCl4\textendash{} ions (6 {\AA} in ionic diameter). With aluminum as the anode, full cells were prepared which simultaneously exhibited both high specific energy (up to 64 Wh kg\textendash{}1, 30 Wh L\textendash{}1) and specific power (up to 290 W kg\textendash{}1, 93 W L\textendash{}1), highly stable cycling performance, and complete reversibility within the potential range of 0.01\textendash{}2.20 V.},

  abstract = {Van der Waals heterostructures have recently emerged as a new class of materials, where quantum coupling between stacked atomically thin two-dimensional layers, including graphene, hexagonal-boron nitride and transition-metal dichalcogenides (MX2), give rise to fascinating new phenomena. MX2 heterostructures are particularly exciting for novel optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications, because two-dimensional MX2 monolayers can have an optical bandgap in the near-infrared to visible spectral range and exhibit extremely strong light\textendash{}matter interactions. Theory predicts that many stacked MX2 heterostructures form type II semiconductor heterojunctions that facilitate efficient electron\textendash{}hole separation for light detection and harvesting. Here, we report the first experimental observation of ultrafast charge transfer in photoexcited MoS2/WS2 heterostructures using both photoluminescence mapping and femtosecond pump\textendash{}probe spectroscopy. We show that hole transfer from the MoS2 layer to the WS2 layer takes place within 50 fs after optical excitation, a remarkable rate for van der Waals coupled two-dimensional layers. Such ultrafast charge transfer in van der Waals heterostructures can enable novel two-dimensional devices for optoelectronics and light harvesting.},

  abstract = {High quality and stable electrical contact between metal and two-dimensional materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, is a necessary requirement that has yet to be achieved in order to successfully exploit the advantages that these materials offer to electronics and optoelectronics. MoTe 2 , owing to its phase changing property, can potentially offer a solution. A recent study demonstrated that metallic phase of MoTe 2 connects its semiconducting phase with very low resistance. To utilize this property to connect other two-dimensional materials, it is important to achieve efficient charge transfer between MoTe 2 and other semiconducting materials. Using MoS 2 as an example, we report ultrafast and efficient charge transfer between MoTe 2 and MoS 2 monolayers. In the transient absorption measurements, an ultrashort pump pulse is used to selectively excite electrons in MoTe 2 . The appearance of the excited electrons in the conduction band of MoS 2 is monitored by using a probe pulse that is tuned to the resonance of MoS 2 . We found that electrons transfer to MoS 2 on a time scale of at most 0.3 ps. The transferred electrons give rise to a large transient absorption signal at both A-exciton and B-exciton resonances due to the screening effect. We also observed ultrafast transfer of holes from MoS 2 to MoTe 2 . Our results suggest the feasibility of using MoTe 2 as a bridge material to connect MoS 2 and other transition metal dichalcogenides, and demonstrate a new transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructure involving MoTe 2 , which extends the spectral range of such structures to infrared.},

  abstract = {Identifying a suitable electrode material with desirable electrochemical properties remains a primary challenge for rechargeable Al-ion batteries. Recently an ultrafast rechargeable Al-ion battery was reported with high charge/discharge rate, (relatively) high discharge voltage and high capacity that uses a graphite-based cathode. Using calculations from first-principles, we have investigated the staging mechanism of AlCl4 intercalation into bulk graphite and evaluated the stability, specific capacity and voltage profile of AlCl4 intercalated compounds. Ab initio molecular dynamics is performed to investigate the thermal stability of AlCl4 intercalated graphite structures. Our voltage profiles show that the first AlCl4 intercalation step could be a more sluggish step than the successive intercalation steps. However, the diffusion of AlCl4 is very fast in the expanded graphite host layers with a diffusion barrier of {$\sim$}0.01 eV, which justifies the ultrafast charging rate of a graphite based Al-ion battery. And such an AlCl4 intercalated battery provides an average voltage of 2.01\textendash{}2.3 V with a maximum specific capacity of 69.62 mA h g-1, which is excellent for anion intercalated batteries. Our density of states and Bader charge analysis shows that the AlCl4 intercalation into the bulk graphite is a charging process. Hence, we believe that our present study will be helpful in understanding the staging mechanism of AlCl4 intercalation into graphite-like layered electrodes for Al-ion batteries, thus encouraging further experimental work.},

Because of this, onion-like carbon can be fabricated into electrodes, used as a conductive additive, and may have potential in composites and additive manufacturing. However due to agglomeration of OLC particles, creating a stable, aqueous dispersion for ink production or formulating composites proves challenging. We explore how attrition milling, acid treatment, and probe sonication can be employed to decrease agglomeration and provide colloidal stability in aqueous media. We also investigate how the electrochemical performance changes with each processing step as well as the treatments in succession. When tested in electrochemical capacitors, the processing increases the capacitance by a factor of three, due to an added pseudocapacitive contribution which is not present in untreated OLC. As a result, the processing of OLC proves to be advantageous for the production of stable, aqueous solutions, which also exhibit improved electrochemical properties suitable for functional inks, conductive additives, and fabrication of composite electrodes.},

In general, the cycle life is influenced more by high charging currents than by high discharging currents. Different boost charging protocols have disclosed that high charging currents can deteriorate cycle life not only at high state of charge (SoC), but also at very low SoC. Our investigations on pulse charging show that lithium-ion cells withstand charging pulses of high current or high voltage without any deterioration in cycle life, when the duration of the pulses remains short and the mean current and voltage values are considerably lower. For pulses of less than 1s, cycle life has been similar for pulsed and continuous charging with the same mean charging currents and identical cycle depths.

Herein, the surface structure and intercalation chemistry of Ti3C2X are clarified at the atomic scale by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The STEM studies show that the functional groups (e.g., OH\textendash, F\textendash, O\textendash{}) and the intercalated sodium (Na) ions prefer to stay on the top sites of the centro-Ti atoms and the C atoms of the Ti3C2 monolayer, respectively. Double Na-atomic layers are found within the Ti3C2X interlayer upon extensive Na intercalation via two-phase transition and solid-solution reactions. In addition, aluminum (Al)-ion intercalation leads to horizontal sliding of the Ti3C2X monolayer. On the basis of these observations, the previous monolayer surface model of Ti3C2X is modified. DFT calculations using the new modeling help to understand more about their physical and chemical properties. These findings enrich the understanding of the MXenes and shed light on future material design and applications. Moreover, the Ti3C2X exhibits prominent rate performance and long-term cycling stability as an anode material for Na-ion batteries.},

The high volumetric capacity of aluminium, which is four and seven times larger than that of lithium and sodium respectively, unarguably has the potential to boost the energy density of aluminium-batteries on a per unit volume basis. Efforts to develop rechargeable aluminium-batteries can be traced to as early as the 1970s, however this area of research has seen a surge in activity since 2010, when the possibility of achieving an ambient temperature aluminium system was convincingly demonstrated. In recent times, rechargeable aluminium-batteries have been rechristened as aluminium-ion batteries. This review aims to comprehensively illustrate the developments regarding rechargeable non-aqueous aluminium-batteries or aluminium-ion batteries. Additionally, the challenges that impede progress in achieving a practical aluminium-ion battery are also discussed.},

  abstract = {As a new type of multi-electron transfer device, rechargeable aluminum batteries are promising post-lithium ion batteries owing to their high theoretical energy density. However, it is unknown whether Al3+ can be reversibly stored in the lattice of the host electrode material because of its small cation diameter and high valence state, thus trapping it tightly in lattice or defect sites. Here, we report the reversible storage of Al3+ in V2O5 nanowires. It is found that Al3+ intercalates into crystalized V2O5 nanowires in the first discharge. Meanwhile, this electrochemical intercalation leads to the reduction of V5+ and the formation of an amorphous layer on the edge of nanowires. In the subsequent cycling, a new phase forms along the nanowires' edges and a two-phase transition reaction occurs. Our findings demonstrate clearly for the first time that it is possible that Al3+ can be inserted into the metal oxide and stored reversibly through intercalation and a phase-transition reaction, which is expected to inspire more comprehensive investigations for rechargeable aluminum batteries.},

A model has been developed which predicts the current-time behavior under the control of Li+ solid state diffusion. The close agreement of this model with the experimental data allows the solid state diffusion coefficient and other transport parameters (such as effective electrode area) to be evaluated from the measured average grain boundary distance. Typical TiS2 grain boundary distances in the 3\textendash{}10 {$\mu$}m range yield a geometric mean value of 1.3 \texttimes{} 10-9 cm2/s for the solid state diffusion coefficient; this is in close agreement with previously reported diffusivities as measured by NMR spin-lattice relaxation techniques.},

  abstract = {The thermodynamic properties of magnesium make it a natural choice for use as an anode material in rechargeable batteries, because it may provide a considerably higher energy density than the commonly used lead\textendash{}acid and nickel\textendash{}cadmium systems. Moreover, in contrast to lead and cadmium, magnesium is inexpensive, environmentally friendly and safe to handle. But the development of Mg batteries has been hindered by two problems. First, owing to the chemical activity of Mg, only solutions that neither donate nor accept protons are suitable as electrolytes; but most of these solutions allow the growth of passivating surface films, which inhibit any electrochemical reaction. Second, the choice of cathode materials has been limited by the difficulty of intercalating Mg ions in many hosts. Following previous studies of the electrochemistry of Mg electrodes in various non-aqueous solutions, and of a variety of intercalation electrodes, we have now developed rechargeable Mg battery systems that show promise for applications. The systems comprise electrolyte solutions based on Mg organohaloaluminate salts, and MgxMo 3S4 cathodes, into which Mg ions can be intercalated reversibly, and with relatively fast kinetics. We expect that further improvements in the energy density will make these batteries a viable alternative to existing systems.},

The effect of pseudocapacitance for maximising the total capacitance is especially documented. Carbons chemically modified by a strong oxidation treatment represent a very well defined region of pseudocapacitance properties due to the Faradaic redox reactions of their rich surface functionality. Conducting polymers (polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene derivatives) and oxidised metallic particles (Ru, Mn, Co,\ldots{}) deposited on the carbons also participate in the enhancement of the final capacity through fast faradaic pseudocapacitance effects.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) shows that the carbon nanotube/graphite foil electrode has a high specific capacitance (115.7 F/g at a scan rate of 100 mV/s) and exhibits typical double-layer behavior. A rectangular-shaped CV curve persists even at a scan rate of 100 mV/s in 1.0 M H2SO4 aqueous solution, which suggests that the carbon nanotube electrode could be an excellent candidate as the electrode in electrochemical double-layer capacitors. In addition, the influence of the potential scan rate, aging, and the electrolyte solution on the specific capacitance of nanotube electrodes was also studied.},

  abstract = {Presently, sustainable energy as well as efficient and economical energy conversion and storage technologies has become important work in light of the rising environmental issues and dependence on portable and uninterrupted power sources. Increasingly more researchers are focusing on harvesting and converting solar energy, mechanical vibration, waste heat, and wind to electricity. Electrical energy storage technologies play a significant role in the demand for green and sustainable energy. Rechargeable batteries or secondary batteries, such as Li-ion batteries, Na-ion batteries, and Mg-ion batteries, reversibly convert between electrical and chemical energy via redox reactions, thus storing the energy as chemical potential in their electrodes. The energy density of a rechargeable battery is determined collectively by the specific capacity of electrodes and the working voltage of the cell, which is the differential potential between the cathode and the anode. Over the past decades, a significant number of studies have focused on enhancing this specific capacity; however, studies to understand and manipulate the electrochemical potential of the electrode materials are limited. In this review, the material characteristics that determine and influence the electrochemical potentials of electrodes are discussed. In particular, the cathode materials that convert electricity and chemical potential through electrochemical intercalation reactions are investigated. In addition, we summarize the selection criteria for elements or compounds and the effect of the local atomic environment on the discharge potential, including the effects of site energy, defects, crystallinity, and microstructure, using LiMn2O4, V2O5, Mo6S8, LiFePO4, and LiCoO2 as model samples for discussion.},

  abstract = {Securing our energy future is the most important problem that humanity faces in this century. Burning fossil fuels is not sustainable, and wide use of renewable energy sources will require a drastically increased ability to store electrical energy. In the move toward an electrical economy, chemical (batteries) and capacitive energy storage (electrochemical capacitors or supercapacitors) devices are expected to play an important role. This Account summarizes research in the field of electrochemical capacitors conducted over the past decade.Overall, the combination of the right electrode materials with a proper electrolyte can successfully increase both the energy stored by the device and its power, but no perfect active material exists and no electrolyte suits every material and every performance goal. However, today, many materials are available, including porous activated, carbide-derived, and templated carbons with high surface areas and porosities that range from subnanometer to just a few nanometers. If the pore size is matched with the electrolyte ion size, those materials can provide high energy density. Exohedral nanoparticles, such as carbon nanotubes and onion-like carbon, can provide high power due to fast ion sorption/desorption on their outer surfaces. Because of its higher charge\textendash{}discharge rates compared with activated carbons, graphene has attracted increasing attention, but graphene had not yet shown a higher volumetric capacitance than porous carbons.Although aqueous electrolytes, such as sodium sulfate, are the safest and least expensive, they have a limited voltage window. Organic electrolytes, such as solutions of [N(C2H5)4]BF4 in acetonitrile or propylene carbonate, are the most common in commercial devices. Researchers are increasingly interested in nonflammable ionic liquids. These liquids have low vapor pressures, which allow them to be used safely over a temperature range from -50 \textdegree{}C to at least 100 \textdegree{}C and over a larger voltage window, which results in a higher energy density than other electrolytes.In situ characterization techniques, such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), and electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance (EQCM) have improved our understanding of the electrical double layer in confinement and desolvation of ions in narrow pores. Atomisitic and continuum modeling have verified and guided these experimental studies. The further development of materials and better understanding of charged solid-electrolyte interfaces should lead to wider use of capacitive energy storage at scales ranging from microelectronics to transportation and the electrical grid. Even with the many exciting results obtained using newer materials, such as graphene and nanotubes, the promising properties reported for new electrode materials do not directly extrapolate to improved device performance. Although thin films of nanoparticles may show a very high gravimetric power density and discharge rate, those characteristics will not scale up linearly with the thickness of the electrode.},

Firstly, the alloying of aluminum with transition metal elements is reviewed and shown to reduce the self-corrosion of Al and improve battery performance. Additionally for the cathode, extensive studies of electrocatalytic materials for oxygen reduction/evolution including Pt and Pt alloys, nonprecious metal catalysts, and carbonaceous materials at the air cathode are highlighted. Moreover, for the electrolyte, the application of aqueous and nonaqueous electrolytes in Al\textendash{}air batteries are discussed. Meanwhile, the addition of inhibitors to the electrolyte to enhance electrochemical performance is also explored. Finally, the challenges and future research directions are proposed for the further development of Al\textendash{}air batteries.},

Similarly, single-layer Li2C3N4 is a good candidate for a lithium-ion anode material with a specific capacity almost twice that of graphite, and bulk LiC4N3 can be used as a cathode material with a specific energy twice that of LiCoO2. The materials have the added advantage that they are stable against clustering of Li and are nontoxic.},

The epoxy groups of graphene oxide (GO) undergo a nucleophilic substitution reaction with dicyandiamide (C2H4N4) to form the C2H4N4\textendash{}GO composite via a covalent C\textendash{}N bond, and then both the in situ polymerization of C2H4N4 and the thermal reduction of GO can be achieved at higher temperatures, forming the covalently coupled g-C3N4\textendash{}rGO. FT-IR, CP-MAS NMR and XPS analyses, clearly revealed a covalent interaction between the g-C3N4 and rGO sheets. The g-C3N4\textendash{}rGO exhibits an unprecedented high, stable and reversible capacity of 1525 mA h g-1 at a current density of 100 mA g-1 after 50 cycles. Even at a large current density of 1000 mA g-1, a reversible capacity of 943 mA h g-1 can still be retained. The superior electrochemical performance of g-C3N4\textendash{}rGO is attributed to the specific characteristics of the unique nanostructure of g-C3N4\textendash{}rGO and the concerted effects of g-C3N4 and rGO, including covalent interactions between the two moieties, the good conductivity and high special surface area of the nanocomposite, as well as the template effect of the planar amino group of g-C3N4 for the dispersed decoration of Li+ ions.},

This kind of aluminum-ion battery comprises of an electrolyte containing AlCl3 in an ionic liquid of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([EMIm]Cl). Galvanostatic charge/discharge measurements have been performed in a voltage range of 0.1\textendash{}2.0 V versus Al/AlCl4
-. An initial discharge specific capacity of 350 mA h g-1 at a current density of 100 mA g-1 is achieved, and the discharge capacity remains over 60 mA h g-1 and coulombic efficiency of 99\% after 100 cycles. Typically, for the current density at 200 mA g-1, the initial charge and discharge capacities are 300 and 235 mA h g-1, respectively. More importantly, it should be emphasized that the battery has a high discharge voltage plateau ({$\approx$}1.0 V vs Al/AlCl4
-). These meaningful results represent a significant step forward in the development of aluminum-ion batteries.},

For lithium-ion batteries, oxidative corrosion of an Al current collector has been a great challenge in designing new electrolyte materials, and only a few lithium salts (e.g. LiPF6) are in practical use. The present work shows effective suppression of Al corrosion up to 4.5\hspace{0.25em}V versus Li+/Li by using a highly concentrated electrolyte of lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide (LiFSA). The corrosion prevention mechanism can be interpreted in relation to a remarkable change in solution structures at a certain threshold concentration.

In fact, 4-trans-2 and 4-trans-1 result among the strongest reversible electron-accepting C60 oligoadducts. Furthermore, the study evidenced that, in both 3 and 4, the CV pattern, and in particular the potential separation between the second and third reductions, changes significantly with the addition pattern. A sequential {$\pi$}-electron model that simulates the effect of subsequent reductions of C60 bis-adducts gives a good correlation (r {$>$} 0.96) with the cyclic voltammetry data when the molecules are divided in two sets dependent on the location of the addends in the same or in opposite hemispheres.},

As expected, after charged at a current density of 5Ag-1, the composites can light up a miniature bulb for more than 70seconds.

Aluminum-based systems, inter alia, are appealing because of the safety and affordability of aluminum anodes. In this work, we examined the recently proposed aluminum\textendash{}ionic liquid\textendash{}graphite architecture. Using 27Al nuclear magnetic resonance, we confirmed that AlCl4\textendash{} acts as an intercalating species. Although previous studies have focused on graphitic cathodes, we analyzed the practicality of achievable energy densities and found that the AlCl3-based ionic liquid is a capacity-limiting anode material. By focusing on both the graphitic cathode and the AlCl3-based anode, we improved the overall energy density. First, high cathodic capacities of {$\leq$}150 mAh g\textendash{}1 and energy efficiencies of 90\% at high electrode loadings of at least 10 mg cm\textendash{}2 were obtained with natural, highly crystalline graphite flakes, which were subjected to minimal mechanical processing. Second, the AlCl3 content in the ionic liquid was increased to its maximal value, which essentially doubled the energy density of the battery, resulting in a cell-level energy density of {$\leq$}62 Wh kg\textendash{}1. The resulting batteries were also characterized by high power densities of at least 489 W kg\textendash{}1.},

The comprehensive characterization of kish graphite flakes and other forms of graphite by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analysis provides solid evidence that the exceptional electrochemical behavior of kish graphite flakes is mainly determined by the high structural order of carbon atoms, a low level of defects, and a unique "crater morphology".

Both energy density and power density of such nanocable-array electrodes are higher than the V2O5 film electrode by at least 1 order of magnitude. Such significant improvement in electrochemical performance is due to the large surface area and short diffusion path offered by the nanostructured V2O5{$\cdot$}nH2O.},

  abstract = {Recently, Li-S batteries with a high theoretical specific energy have attracted significant attention. However, their practical application is still seriously hindered by the shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) in the Li-S batteries system. Introducing anchoring materials into the cathode or separator, which can strongly attract LiPSs because of advisable binding energies, has been demonstrated as an effective strategy to alleviate the shuttling effect for achieving the excellent cycling performance of Li-S batteries. In this work, the complete mechanistic understanding of the interaction between non-metallic monolayer materials (N-MMLMs, including Graphene, BN, C2N and C3N4) and LiPSs is given in detail with the aid of density functional theory. The calculation results show that N-MMLM can combine the chemical interaction and the physical entrapment of sulfur species to suppress the shuttling effect. C3N4 and C2N are predicted to trap LiPSs via stronger interfacial interaction and alleviate the interactions between LiPSs and solvents as well as the consequent dissolution. The strong anchoring effect of C3N4/C2N comes from the bonding of Li-N/C-S and charge transfer. Further charge transfer study reveals that the C3N4/C2N can serve as an electrocatalyst, which effectively accelerates the kinetics of LiPSs redox reactions.},

Introducing anchoring materials, which can induce strong binding interaction with Li2Sn species, has been demonstrated as an effective way to overcome this problem and achieve long-term cycling stability and high-rate performance. The interaction between Li2Sn species and anchoring materials should be studied at the atomic level in order to understand the mechanism behind the anchoring effect and to identify ideal anchoring materials to further improve the performance of Li\textendash{}S batteries. Using first-principles approach with van der Waals interaction included, we systematically investigate the adsorption of Li2Sn species on various two-dimensional layered materials (oxides, sulfides, and chlorides) and study the detailed interaction and electronic structure, including binding strength, configuration distortion, and charge transfer. We gain insight into how van der Waals interaction and chemical binding contribute to the adsorption of Li2Sn species for anchoring materials with strong, medium, and weak interactions. We understand why the anchoring materials can avoid the detachment of Li2S as in carbon substrate, and we discover that too strong binding strength can cause decomposition of Li2Sn species.},

Compared with monometal sulfides, MMSs exhibit greatly enhanced electrochemical performance, which is largely originated from their higher electronic conductivity and richer redox reactions. In this review, recent progresses in the rational design and synthesis of diverse MMS-based micro/nanostructures with controlled morphologies, sizes, and compositions for LIBs, SIBs, HSCs, MABs, and water splitting are summarized. In particular, nanostructuring, synthesis of nanocomposites with carbonaceous materials and fabrication of 3D MMS-based electrodes are demonstrated to be three effective approaches for improving the electrochemical performance of MMS-based electrode materials. Furthermore, some potential challenges as well as prospects are discussed to further advance the development of MMS-based electrode materials for next-generation electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems.},

Special attention is given to the use of Al in Al-air cells with porous C or, preferably, porous Ni air cathodes. Anode polarization and current efficiency data are presented for both the self-regenerating and the consumable electrolytes with and without several effective corrosion inhibitors consisting of alkyldimethylbenzylammonium salts and/or Hg with or without . It is concluded that optimum battery performance would result from the use of some of these inhibitors, as well as from elimination of sulfides and other corrosion accelerators, use of highly pure Al or specially resistant Al-Mg, Al-Zn, or Al-Hg alloys, effective heat removal, operation at high current densities (preferably {$\geq$}10 ma/cm2), and anode-electrolyte separation during periods of inaction.},

The substitution of lithium with alternative metal anodes characterized by lower cost and higher abundance is nowadays one of the most widely explored paths to reduce the cost of electrochemical storage systems and enable long-term sustainability. Aluminum based secondary batteries could be a viable alternative to the present Li-ion technology because of their high volumetric capacity (8040 mAh cm(-3) for Al vs 2046 mAh cm(-3) for Li). Additionally, the low cost aluminum makes these batteries appealing for large-scale electrical energy storage. Here, we describe the evolution of the various aluminum systems, starting from those based on aqueous electrolytes to, in more details, those based on non-aqueous electrolytes. Particular attention has been dedicated to the latest development of electrolytic media characterized by low reactivity towards other cell components. The attention is then focused on electrode materials enabling the reversible aluminum intercalation-deintercalation process. Finally, we touch on the topic of high-capacity aluminum-sulfur batteries, attempting to forecast their chances to reach the status of practical energy storage systems.},

However, renewable energy outputs are variable due to a stochastic characteristic of their sources. Electrical power system operators around the world are faced with difficulties of integrating these variable power sources into the existing power grids. Energy storage systems are one of the possible solutions for mitigating the effects of intermittent renewable resources on networks, allowing increased renewable energy utilization, and providing flexibility and ancillary services for managing future electricity supply/demand challenges. This paper presents a comprehensive review of energy storage technologies that are currently engaged for power applications, including pumped hydro, compressed-air, battery, flywheel, capacitor, supercapacitor, superconducting magnetic and thermal systems. The study compares the characteristics of these systems, and presents their technological development status and capital costs. Some directions for future work are also highlighted. Furthermore, particular attention is paid to some new storage technologies such as: adiabatic, underwater, isothermal and small-scale compressed-air; sub-surface, seawater and variable-speed pumped hydro, and pumped heat systems, which hold opportunity for future smart electrical grid applications, but there is need for more research to actualize their promising potentials.},

  volume = {8},

  abstract = {Graphite and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) are two prominent members of the family of layered materials possessing a hexagonal lattice structure. While graphite has nonpolar homonuclear C\textendash{}C intralayer bonds, h-BN presents highly polar B\textendash{}N bonds resulting in different optimal stacking modes of the two materials in the bulk form. Furthermore, the static polarizabilities of the constituent atoms considerably differ from each other, suggesting large differences in the dispersive component of the interlayer bonding. Despite these major differences, both materials present practically identical interlayer distances. To understand this finding, a comparative study of the nature of the interlayer bonding in both materials is presented. A full lattice sum of the interactions between the partially charged atomic centers in h-BN results in vanishingly small contributions to the interlayer binding energy. Higher order electrostatic multipoles, exchange, and short-range correlation Kohn\textendash{}Sham contributions are found to be very similar in both materials and to almost completely cancel out by the kinetic energy term, which partly represents the effects of Pauli repulsions, at physically relevant interlayer distances, resulting in a marginal effective contribution to the interlayer binding. Further analysis of the dispersive energy term reveals that despite the large differences in the individual atomic polarizabilities, the heteroatomic B\textendash{}N C6 coefficient is very similar to the homoatomic C\textendash{}C coefficient in the hexagonal bulk form, resulting in very similar dispersive contribution to the interlayer binding. The overall binding energy curves of both materials are thus very similar, predicting practically the same interlayer distance and very similar binding energies. The conclusions drawn here regarding the role of electrostatic interactions between partially charged atomic centers for the interlayer binding of h-BN are of a general nature and are expected to hold true for many other polar layered systems.},

  abstract = {Herein we report, for the first time, an overall evaluation of commercially available battery separators to be used for aluminum batteries, revealing that most of them are not stable in the highly reactive 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride:aluminum trichloride (EMIMCl:AlCl3) electrolyte conventionally employed in rechargeable aluminum batteries. Subsequently, a novel highly stable polyacrylonitrile (PAN) separator obtained by the electrospinning technique for application in high-performance aluminum batteries has been prepared. The developed PAN separator has been fully characterized in terms of morphology, thermal stability, and air permeability, revealing its suitability as a separator for battery applications. Furthermore, extremely good compatibility and improved aluminum interface stability in the highly reactive EMIMCl:AlCl3 electrolyte were discovered. The use of the PAN separator strongly affects the aluminum dissolution/deposition process, leading to a quite homogeneous deposition compared to that of a glass fiber separator. Finally, the applicability of the PAN separator has been demonstrated in aluminum/graphite cells. The electrochemical tests evidence the full compatibility of the PAN separator in aluminum cells. Furthermore, the aluminum/graphite cells employing the PAN separator are characterized by a slightly higher delivered capacity compared to those employing glass fiber separators, confirming the superior characteristics of the PAN separator as a more reliable separator for the emerging aluminum battery technology.},

Aluminum based rechargeable ion batteries offer the possibilities for safe, high energy density and low cost. Here, we developed a novel aluminum based high-rate capability dual-ion battery with an aluminum anode and a 3D graphene cathode. The battery operated through the electrochemical deposition and dissolution of aluminum at the anode, and intercalation/de-intercalation of ClO4- anions in the graphene based cathode with a new Al(ClO4)3/Propylene carbonate - Fluoroethylene carbonate electrolyte. The battery exhibited high discharge voltage plateaus (about 1V), high-rate capacity (101mAhg-1 at 2000mAg-1) and long cycle life (more than 400 cycles). More importantly, the battery also showed superior electrochemical properties with fast charge and slow discharge (the battery could be fully charged in 13min and discharged for more than 73min). And the reaction mechanisms of the aluminum based dual-ion battery is also proposed and discussed in detail.},

In this contribution, exceptional graphene nanosheet (GN) papers that are well stacked by conductive graphene nanosheets have been demonstrated as an electrochemically stable host for fast AlCl4- ion transport/storage along with high volumetric/areal energy storage at a dense state (1.6\textasciitilde{}1.8gcm-3). Owing to the exclusive morphological and chemical advantages, the as-assembled AIBs with the binder-free GN paper cathode enables to deliver considerably high specific capacity 100mAhg-1 at the current density 50mAg-1 (approaching the theoretic value of carbon AIB cathodes), coupled with much enhanced volumetric capacity, areal energy density and power density compared to the reported carbon AIB cathodes. Particularly, the term of tortuosity has been employed to understand the fundamental relationship between volumetric energy performance and microscopic structures, which suggests a unique platform for developing advanced practical AIBs.},

This raises an interesting problem concerning how the AlCl4 clusters can diffuse so fast in the graphite cathode. In this paper, we first demonstrate by means of density functional theory calculations that AlCl4 cluster exists in graphite with planar quadrangle geometry, rather than a tetrahedral structure. Upon AlCl4 intercalation, the interlayer spacing distance between graphene layers is substantially enlarged from 3.353{\AA} to 6.025{\AA}. With such a large spacing, the AlCl4 diffusion becomes very easy with migration energy barriers ranging from 0.023 to 0.089eV for different migration paths in a 2-dimensional diffusion plane. These results give underlying explanation to the dynamic performance of the graphite-based Al-ion batteries.},

The lowest electrical volume resistivity and highest compressibility were found for C-NERGY\texttrademark{} Super C45 dry-mixed with LiCoO2 powder. Mixing by high shear forces in acetone dispersion improved the electrical resistivity and compressibility of the C-NERGY\texttrademark{} Super C65 containing LiCoO2 mixture to the same level obtained for the C-NERGY\texttrademark{} Super C45 mixture in the same process. Acetone dispersions of C-NERGY\texttrademark{} Super C45 and LiCoO2 showed the lowest viscosities attributed to the carbon black's specific BET surface area of 45m2g-1 being the lowest of all carbon blacks studied. The easy dispersibility of C-NERGY\texttrademark{} Super C45 in LiCoO2 could be explained by its particular surface group chemistry characterized by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. The electrical volume resistivity of the LiCoO2/carbon black mixtures was in line with the high current rate performance of half-cells with related LiCoO2 electrodes. Compared to the investigated carbon blacks, the electrical volume resistivity of the graphite conductive additives C-NERGY\texttrademark{} KS6L and C-NERGY\texttrademark{} SFG6L at different concentrations in LiCoO2 powders showed higher critical volume fractions but lower ultimate resistivity levels. Adding one of these graphites to the carbon black conductive mass improved the electrode density and, at concentrations above the critical volume fraction of the graphite component, significantly decreased the ultimate resistivity level of the LiCoO2 electrode mass.},

The comprehensive characterization of kish graphite flakes and other forms of graphite by X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and Brunauer\textendash{}Emmett\textendash{}Teller surface area analysis provides solid evidence that the exceptional electrochemical behavior of kish graphite flakes is mainly determined by the high structural order of carbon atoms, a low level of defects, and a unique ``crater morphology''.

  title = {Research on Superconducting Magnetic Energy Storage in the Photovoltaic Distributed Generation},
  abstract = {With the development of power system, the disadvantages of power system stability appeared. Because of the rapid development of power electronic technology, people have paid more close attention to distributed generation (DG). The intermittence and unpredictable nature of the wind or solar power make the successful integration of the DG schemes, which based on green/clean energy, a challenging task. As an energy storage element, superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) plays a very important role in improving operating stability of the whole system, which is made of the DG and the power system. SMES is coupled with the DG system through a power electronic converter. This paper constitutes a combination of the DG system and SMES. Take distributed by photovoltaic generation system as an example, a structure of the DG system with SMES is designed. An exact simulation model of DG system with SMES equipment is set up. The results of simulation demonstrate that the SMES equipment can substantially improve operating stability of the DG system and the power system. The experimental prototype with the capacity of 10 kVA is completed.},

  abstract = {Electrical power generation is changing dramatically across the world because of the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to introduce mixed energy sources. The power network faces great challenges in transmission and distribution to meet demand with unpredictable daily and seasonal variations. Electrical Energy Storage (EES) is recognized as underpinning technologies to have great potential in meeting these challenges, whereby energy is stored in a certain state, according to the technology used, and is converted to electrical energy when needed. However, the wide variety of options and complex characteristic matrices make it difficult to appraise a specific EES technology for a particular application. This paper intends to mitigate this problem by providing a comprehensive and clear picture of the state-of-the-art technologies available, and where they would be suited for integration into a power generation and distribution system. The paper starts with an overview of the operation principles, technical and economic performance features and the current research and development of important EES technologies, sorted into six main categories based on the types of energy stored. Following this, a comprehensive comparison and an application potential analysis of the reviewed technologies are presented.},

  abstract = {Energy storage systems (ESS) provide a means for improving the efficiency of electrical systems when there are imbalances between supply and demand. Additionally, they are a key element for improving the stability and quality of electrical networks. They add flexibility into the electrical system by mitigating the supply intermittency, recently made worse by an increased penetration of renewable generation. One energy storage technology now arousing great interest is the flywheel energy storage systems (FESS), since this technology can offer many advantages as an energy storage solution over the alternatives. Flywheels have attributes of a high cycle life, long operational life, high round-trip efficiency, high power density, low environmental impact, and can store megajoule (MJ) levels of energy with no upper limit when configured in banks. This paper presents a critical review of FESS in regards to its main components and applications, an approach not captured in earlier reviews. Additionally, earlier reviews do not include the most recent literature in this fast-moving field. A description of the flywheel structure and its main components is provided, and different types of electric machines, power electronics converter topologies, and bearing systems for use in flywheel storage systems are discussed. The main applications of FESS are explained and commercially available flywheel prototypes for each application are described. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research.},

  issn = {2198-3844},
  abstract = {In the search for low-cost and large-scale stationary storage of electricity, nonaqueous aluminum chloride-graphite batteries (AlCl3-GBs) have received much attention due to the high natural abundances of their primary constituents, facile manufacturing, and high energy densities. Much research has focused on the judicious selection of graphite cathode materials, leading to the most notable recent advances in the performance of AlCl3-GBs. However, the major obstacle to commercializing this technology is the lack of oxidatively stable, inexpensive current collectors that can operate in chloroaluminate ionic liquids and are composed of earth-abundant elements. This study presents the use of titanium nitride (TiN) as a compelling material for this purpose. Flexible current collectors can be fabricated by coating TiN on stainless steel or flexible polyimide substrates by low-cost, rapid, scalable methods such as magnetron sputtering. When these current collectors are used in AlCl3-GB coin or pouch cells, stable cathodic operation is observed at voltages of up to 2.5 V versus Al3+/Al. Furthermore, these batteries have a high coulombic efficiency of 99.5\%, power density of 4500 W kg-1, and cyclability of at least 500 cycles.},

The use of more expensive lithium precursor materials results in less than 1\% increases in the cost of lithium ion cells considered. Similarly, larger fluctuations in the global lithium price (from \$0 to \$25/kg from a baseline of \$7.50 per kg of Li2CO3) do not change the cost of lithium ion cells by more than 10\%.

  abstract = {Metal\textendash{}air batteries are a well-established technology that can offer high energy densities, low cost and environmental responsibility. Despite these favourable characteristics and utilisation of oxygen as the cathode reactant, these devices have been limited to primary applications, due to a number of problems that occur when the cell is recharged, including electrolyte loss and poor efficiency. Overcoming these obstacles is essential to creating a rechargeable metal\textendash{}air battery that can be utilised for efficiently capturing renewable energy. Despite the first metal\textendash{}air battery being created over 100 years ago, the emergence of reactive metals such as lithium has reinvigorated interest in this field. However the reactivity of some of these metals has generated a number of different philosophies regarding the electrolyte of the metal\textendash{}air battery. Whilst much is already known about the anode and cathode processes in aqueous and organic electrolytes, the shortcomings of these electrolytes (i.e. volatility, instability, flammability etc.) have led some of the metal\textendash{}air battery community to study room temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) as non-volatile, highly stable electrolytes that have the potential to support rechargeable metal\textendash{}air battery processes. In this perspective, we discuss how some of these initial studies have demonstrated the capabilities of RTILs as metal\textendash{}air battery electrolytes. We will also show that much of the long-held mechanistic knowledge of the oxygen electrode processes might not be applicable in RTIL based electrolytes, allowing for creative new solutions to the traditional irreversibility of the oxygen reduction reaction. Our understanding of key factors such as the effect of catalyst chemistry and surface structure, proton activity and interfacial reactions is still in its infancy in these novel electrolytes. In this perspective we highlight the key areas that need the attention of electrochemists and battery engineers, in order to progress the understanding of the physical and electrochemical processes in RTILs as electrolytes for the various forms of rechargeable metal\textendash{}air batteries.},

However, their large-scale application is hindered by severe safety concerns when the cells are exposed to mechanical, thermal, or electrical abuse conditions. These safety issues are intrinsically related to their superior energy density, combined with the (present) utilization of highly volatile and flammable organic-solvent-based electrolytes. Herein, state-of-the-art electrolyte systems and potential alternatives are briefly surveyed, with a particular focus on their (inherent) safety characteristics. The challenges, which so far prevent the widespread replacement of organic carbonate-based electrolytes with LiPF6 as the conducting salt, are also reviewed herein. Starting from rather ``facile'' electrolyte modifications by (partially) replacing the organic solvent or lithium salt and/or the addition of functional electrolyte additives, conceptually new electrolyte systems, including ionic liquids, solvent-free, and/or gelled polymer-based electrolytes, as well as solid-state electrolytes, are also considered. Indeed, the opportunities for designing new electrolytes appear to be almost infinite, which certainly complicates strict classification of such systems and a fundamental understanding of their properties. Nevertheless, these innumerable opportunities also provide a great chance of developing highly functionalized, new electrolyte systems, which may overcome the afore-mentioned safety concerns, while also offering enhanced mechanical, thermal, physicochemical, and electrochemical performance.},

Thereby, there is a strong driving force to develop power sources technologies beyond Li-ion batteries that will mark breakthroughs in energy density capabilities. Li-sulfur batteries have high theoretical energy density that can revolutionize electrochemical propulsion capability. Consequently, in recent years there has been much work throughout the world related to these systems. The scope of work on this topic justifies frequent publications of review articles that summarize recent extensive work and provide guidelines and direction for focused future work. Here, a comprehensive, systematic work related to Li-sulfur battery systems is described, beginning with the Li anode challenges, carbon-encapsulated sulfur cathodes, and various kinds of relevant electrolyte solutions.

  abstract = {A Li-air battery could potentially provide three to five times higher energy density/specific energy than conventional batteries and, thus, enable the driving range of an electric vehicle to be comparable to gasoline vehicles. However, making Li-air batteries rechargeable presents significant challenges, mostly related to the materials. Here, the key factors that influence the rechargeability of Li-air batteries are discussed with a focus on nonaqueous systems. The status and materials challenges for nonaqueous rechargeable Li-air batteries are reviewed. These include electrolytes, cathode (electrocatalysts), lithium metal anodes, and oxygen-selective membranes (oxygen supply from air). A perspective for the future of rechargeable Li-air batteries is provided.},

The crystallographic information on the subject of graphite is scanty. It has generally been accepted as hexagonal with a well-marked basal cleavage; but besides the cleavage face few other faces have ever been observed on it. Kenngott, the earliest observer, seems to have obtained the best crystal, and measured planes, to which he gave the indices 10͞11 and 11͞21, making angles of 58\textdegree{} and 70\textdegree{} 18' respectively with the basal plane 0001. (These results are strikingly confirmed by X-ray measurements, which make the corresponding angles 58\textdegree{} 8' and 70\textdegree{} 13'.) Nordenski{\"o}ld considered graphite monoclinic, on account of the variability of its angles; but his conclusions were questioned by Sj{\"o}gren, who, in a very full paper, adduced a number of reasons (twinning, percussion and etch figures, thermal conductivity) to show that it was hexagonal. Quite recently the researches of Gaubert have added a knowledge of the optical properties of graphite. In very thin flakes it is transparent, uniaxial and negatively birefringent, with a refractive index of about 2. This settles definitely that it has trigonal hexagonal symmetry. The X-ray analysis of graphite has lagged considerably behind that of the diamond. Bragg in 1914 made a measurement of the spacing of the cleavage planes, finding it to be 3{$\cdot$}42 A. U., while Ewald, in the same year, took a Laue photograph of a crystal, perpendicular to the axis, confirming its hexagonal symmetry. The fuller interpretation of its structure was attempted by Hull and by Debye and Scherrer in 1917 by the powder method. Both were able to assign a structure to the element, but these structures have different lattices and belong to different crystal systems. An examination of the original papers shows that the observations of neither investigator are in very good agreement with the structure they propose, and the observations only show the roughest agreement with each other. This is especially marked in the matter of intensities. On the whole, Hull's results are more plausible, because he separated the K{$\alpha$} and K{$\beta$} lines of Mo by screening, whereas Debye and Scherrer often mistook {$\alpha$} for {$\beta$} lines, as will be shown subsequently. Since then Backhurst has made some measurements on graphite, from the point of view of its expansion and the effect of temperature on the reflection intensities.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the computational assessment of the electrochemical stability of a series of alkyl methylimidazolium-based ionic liquids for their use as lithium battery electrolytes. The oxidation and reduction potentials of the constituent cation and anion of each ionic liquid with respect to a Li+/Li reference electrode were calculated using density functional theory following the method of thermodynamic cycles, and the electrochemical stability windows (ESW)s of these ionic liquids were obtained. The effect of varying the length of alkyl side chains of the methylimidazolium-based cations on the redox potentials and ESWs was investigated. The results show that the limits of the ESWs of these methylimidazolium-based ionic liquids are defined by the oxidation potential of the anions and the reduction potential of alkyl-methylimidazolium cations. Moreover, ionic liquids with [PF6]- anion have a wider ESW. In addition to characterizing structure\textendash{}function relationships, the accuracy of the computational approach was assessed through comparisons of the data against experimental measurements of ESWs. The potentials calculated by the thermodynamic cycle method are in good agreement with the experimental data while the HOMO/LUMO method overestimates the redox potentials. This work demonstrates that these approaches can provide guidance in selecting ionic liquid electrolytes when designing high-voltage rechargeable batteries.},

This strategy is demonstrated with a solid electrolyte that not only is wet by the metallic anode, but also has a dielectric constant capable of creating a large electric-double-layer capacitance at the two electrode/electrolyte interfaces.

  abstract = {Due to increasing concerns about global warming, greenhouse gas emissions, and the depletion of fossil fuels, the electric vehicles (EVs) receive massive popularity due to their performances and efficiencies in recent decades. EVs have already been widely accepted in the automotive industries considering the most promising replacements in reducing CO2 emissions and global environmental issues. Lithium-ion batteries have attained huge attention in EVs application due to their lucrative features such as lightweight, fast charging, high energy density, low self-discharge and long lifespan. This paper comprehensively reviews the lithium-ion battery state of charge (SOC) estimation and its management system towards the sustainable future EV applications. The significance of battery management system (BMS) employing lithium-ion batteries is presented, which can guarantee a reliable and safe operation and assess the battery SOC. The review identifies that the SOC is a crucial parameter as it signifies the remaining available energy in a battery that provides an idea about charging/discharging strategies and protect the battery from overcharging/over discharging. It is also observed that the SOC of the existing lithium-ion batteries have a good contribution to run the EVs safely and efficiently with their charging/discharging capabilities. However, they still have some challenges due to their complex electro-chemical reactions, performance degradation and lack of accuracy towards the enhancement of battery performance and life. The classification of the estimation methodologies to estimate SOC focusing with the estimation model/algorithm, benefits, drawbacks and estimation error are extensively reviewed. The review highlights many factors and challenges with possible recommendations for the development of BMS and estimation of SOC in next-generation EV applications. All the highlighted insights of this review will widen the increasing efforts towards the development of the advanced SOC estimation method and energy management system of lithium-ion battery for the future high-tech EV applications.},

Moreover the assembled supercapacitor device yields a maximum energy density of 12 Wh kg\textendash{}1, which is higher than that of commercially available supercapacitors. By taking advantage of the complex multilayered structure of a hemp bast fiber precursor, such exquisite carbons were able to be achieved by simple hydrothermal carbonization combined with activation. This novel precursor-synthesis route presents a great potential for facile large-scale production of high-performance carbons for a variety of diverse applications including energy storage.},

  abstract = {Exploring suitable electrode materials is a fundamental step toward developing Al batteries with enhanced performance. In this work, we explore using density functional theory calculations the feasibility of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) as a cathode material for Al batteries. Carbon nanotubes with hollow structures and large surface area are able to overcome the difficulty of activating the opening of interlayer spaces as observed in graphite electrode during the first intercalation cycle. Our results show that AlCl4 binds strongly with the SWNT to result in an energetically and thermally stable AlCl4-adsorbed SWNT system. Diffusion calculations show that the SWNT system allows ultrafast diffusion of AlCl4 with a more favorable inner surface diffusion than outer surface diffusion. Our charge-density difference and Bader atomic charge analysis confirm the oxidation of SWNT upon adsorption of AlCl4, which shows a similar behavior to the previously studied graphite cathode. The average open-circuit voltage and AlCl4 storage capacity increases with increasing SWNT diameter and can be as high as 1.96\hspace{0.25em}V and 275\hspace{0.25em}mA\,h\,g-1 in (25,25) SWNT relative to graphite (70\hspace{0.25em}mA\,h\,g-1).

The unique 3D electrode architecture prevented deformation of the electrode during cycling. The absence of binder and conducting additive simplifies the electrode fabrication process, thus lowering the battery fabrication costs. As a proof of concept, the anode when tested against lithium delivered a specific discharge capacity of 764~mA~h~g-1 at a current density of 50~mA~g-1, with an exceptional cycling stability at high current rates (e.g., delivering a capacity of 664~mA~h~g-1 at 500th cycle at a current density of 1~A~g-1). Furthermore, the anode was also tested against sodium, exhibiting a reversible discharge capacity of 241~mA~h~g-1 in the second cycle at a current density of 50~mA~g-1 and remained stable over prolonged cycling. The ion storage mechanism was studied using ex-situ spectroscopic techniques.},

Super-P (30 nm) and Lonza-KS6 (6 {$\mu$}m) were selected as the components for the binary conductive agents. The total amount and the ratio of the two components of the binary conductive agents were varied. At a fixed Lonza/Super-P ratio of 1:1, the cathode with the higher conductive agent content showed a lower electrical resistance and a lower density, which resulted in better rate and cycling characteristics. However, this advantage was somewhat offset by the decrease of energy density. At a fixed binary conductive agent content of 8 wt.\%, the electrode density increased and the surface electrode resistance decreased with increasing Super-P content. In spite of the decreased ionic diffusion rate, the charge transfer resistance was decreased and the rate capability was increased with increasing Super-P content, which indicated that the formation of effective electronic conduction paths was highly important. The SEM microscopic observation and measurement of planar density of LiCoO2 indicate that the addition of a small amount of Lonza-KS6 provides a uniform dispersion of LiCoO2 particles in the cathode. As a consequence, the cell with the binary conductive agent at an appropriate Lonza/Super-P ratio had a better cycle life than those with single conductive agents.},

The shape of the CVs confirms that electrodeposition of aluminium was feasible in the three materials but the highest peak currents and smallest peak separation in the CV of the aluminium anode suggested that this material was the most promising. Interestingly, carbon-based substrates appeared as an interesting alternative due to the high peak currents in CV, moderate overpotentials and dual role as anode and cathode. 3D substrates such as fiber-based carbon paper and aluminium mesh showed significantly smaller overpotentials and higher efficiencies for Al reaction suggesting that the use of 3D substrates in full batteries might result in enhanced power.

Among them, Al-ion batteries based on aluminum anode and graphite carbon cathode have gained lots of interests as one of the most promising technologies. Here, it is demonstrated that the size of graphitic material in ab plane and c direction plays an important role in anion intercalation chemistry. Sharply decreasing the size of vertical dimension (c direction) strongly facilitates the kinetics and charge transfer of anions (de)intercalation. On the other hand, increasing the size of horizontal dimension (ab plane) contributes to improving the flexibility of graphitic materials, which results in raising the cycling stability. Meanwhile, chloroaluminate anions are reversibly intercalated into the interlayer of graphite materials, leading to the staging behaviors.

In this research, porous microspheric copper oxide (PM-CuO) composed of stacked numerous bitty nanorods has been synthesized for use in AIBs. Using a simple one-pot hydrothermal process, the-as-synthesized PM-CuO possess a large specific surface area of 21.61 m2 g-1 and a pore volume of 0.179 cm3 g-1. These unique porous features allow PM-CuO to improve the electrochemical performance in the assembled AIBs, which exhibit a high initial charge and discharge capacity of 270.62 and 250.12 mA h g-1 (current density of 50 mA g-1), respectively. In the cycling performance, discharge capacity was observed to remain over 130, 121 and 112 mA h g-1 at current densities of 50, 100 and 200 mA g-1, respectively. The favorable properties of PM-CuO cathode materials are attributed to the unique porous structure and this makes them a promising potential material for use as energy storage devices.},

It is found that not only AlCl4- but also Al3+ could also be intercalated and deintercalated into the prelithium graphite electrode material. The CV result clearly shows that the Graphite-Li electrode material has two pairs of redox peaks, which can be attributed to the AlCl4- and Al3+ intercalation and deintercalation into the electrode materials, respectively. In addition, the discharge specific capacity of Graphite-Li (68.2 mAh g-1) is significantly higher than Graphite (49.2 mAh g-1) at the currert density of 200 mA g-1. The discharge capacity of Graphite-Li can still reach 64 mAh g-1 even after 500 cycles with a coulombic efficiency close to 100\%. Such remarkable electrochemical performance is attributed to the fact that the interlayer spacing is improved by prelithiation treatment which reduces the electrostatic effect between Al3+ or AlCl4- and electrode materials.},

  abstract = {With revolutionary electric vehicles and the smart grid fast developing, more advanced energy storage technologies become quite crucial issues. Li-ion batteries (LIBs) and Na-ion batteries (NIBs) are considered as the most promising electrochemical energy storage technologies. Low-dimensional nano-structural electrode materials can greatly increase the specific capacity, but they still suffer from poor cycling and rate performances due to their serious self-aggregations. Constructing 3D structures, such as micro/nano-structures and free-standing electrodes, is a quite promising method to address the above issues. Such 3D structures can simultaneously avoid the disadvantages of low-dimensional nanomaterials, and preserve their advantages. As one group of promising high-capacity and low-cost electrode materials, vanadium-based oxides have exhibited an quite attractive electrochemical performance for energy storage applications in many novel works. However, their systematic reviews are quite limited, which is disadvantageous to their further development. Herein, this article provides an overview of vanadium-based oxides in the applications of LIBs and NIBs by focusing mainly on the aspect from low-dimensional nanomaterials synthesis to 3D micro/nano-structures and free-standing electrodes fabrication. Moreover, a feasible strategy to controllably fabricate the 3D micro/nano-structure for the whole vanadium-based oxides family is presented. Furthermore, and importantly, a quite promising solution method for the practical commercialized applications of vanadium oxides cathode materials in the future is proposed, i.e., fabricating the ``vanadium oxides-based cathode/solid electrolyte/Li metal anode-type'' all solid-state secondary-ion batteries.},

We exclude the possibility of Al3+ cation intercalation into graphite as in standard Li-ion batteries. Instead, we show that the AlCl4- anion intercalation mechanism is thermodynamically feasible. By including the ionic liquid electrolyte in the overall redox reaction, we are able to reproduce the high voltage observed in experiment. The active involvement of electrolyte in the reaction suggests that the evaluation of energy density needs to take the electrolyte into consideration. Our proposed structural model is consistent with the new peaks appearing in X-ray diffraction from the intercalation compound. The high rate capability is explained by the ultralow diffusion barriers of the AlCl4 intercalant. With the clarified working mechanism, it becomes clear that the high voltage of the Al-graphite cell is a result of the thermodynamic instability of the AlCl4-intercalated graphite. \textcopyright{} 2017 American Chemical Society.},

Here, we discover that it is aluminum oxide film that efficiently restricts the growth of crystalline Al dendrite and thus improves the cycling stability of Al anode. The key role of surficial aluminum oxide film in protecting Al metal anode lies in decreasing the nucleation sites, controlling the metallic dendrite growth, and preventing the electrode disintegration. The defect sites in aluminum oxide film provide channels for electrolyte infiltration and further stripping/depositing.

Several low-energy pathways are observed for the diffusion process, and it is observed that the AlCl4 diffusion is trouble-free in the two-dimensional plane of BC3, having a diffusion barrier as low as 0.38 eV. Moreover, we have observed that BC3 can provide a higher average voltage 2.41 V and specific capacity of 74.37 mAh/g.

The impact of ball milling time on microstructure and particle size reduction of h-BN powder was investigated by FESEM, FTIR, XRD, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and particle size analyser.It was indicated that high energy ball milling is effective up to 10 hours in reducing the particles size a further increase in time is resulting in agglomeration. Microhardness of the composite increases in proportion to increases in weight percentage of reinforcement, h-BN exhibited a poor sinterability without any accelerating agentand with tin addition up to 0.5\% low melting point metal.TGA and DTA study shows that there is reduction in melting point from 641\textdegree{}C to 638 \textdegree{}C with addition of 2\% weight fraction of h-BN.

  abstract = {In this study, magnesium composites with nano-size boron nitride (BN) particulates of varying contents were synthesized using the powder metallurgy (PM) technique incorporating microwave-assisted two-directional sintering followed by hot extrusion. The effect of nano-BN addition on the microstructural and the mechanical behavior of the developed Mg/BN composites were studied in comparison with pure Mg using the structure-property correlation. Microstructural characterization revealed uniform distribution of nano-BN particulates and marginal grain refinement. The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) value of the magnesium matrix was improved with the addition of nano-sized BN particulates. The results of XRD studies indicate basal texture weakening with an increase in nano-BN addition. The composites showed improved mechanical properties measured under micro-indentation, tension and compression loading. While the tensile yield strength improvement was marginal, a significant increase in compressive yield strength was observed. This resulted in the reduction of tension-compression yield asymmetry and can be attributed to the weakening of the strong basal texture.},

The growth rate of h-BN film at a constant temperature is strongly affected by the concentration of borazine as a precursor and the ambient gas condition such as the ratio of hydrogen and nitrogen. h-BN films with different thicknesses can be achieved by controlling the growth time or tuning the growth conditions. Transmission electron microscope characterization reveals that these h-BN films are polycrystalline, and the c-axis of the crystallites points to different directions. The stoichiometry ratio of boron and nitrogen is close to 1:1, obtained by electron energy loss spectroscopy.

  abstract = {The controlled exfoliation of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) into single- or few-layered nanosheets remains a grand challenge and becomes the bottleneck to essential studies and applications of h-BN. Here, we present an efficient strategy for the scalable synthesis of few-layered h-BN nanosheets (BNNS) using a novel gas exfoliation of bulk h-BN in liquid N2 (L-N2). The essence of this strategy lies in the combination of a high temperature triggered expansion of bulk h-BN and the cryogenic L-N2 gasification to exfoliate the h-BN. The produced BNNS after ten cycles (BNNS-10) consisted primarily of fewer than five atomic layers with a high mass yield of 16\textendash{}20\,\%. N2 sorption and desorption isotherms show that the BNNS-10 exhibited a much higher specific surface area of 278\hspace{0.25em}m2\,g-1 than that of bulk BN (10\hspace{0.25em}m2\,g-1). Through the investigation of the exfoliated intermediates combined with a theoretical calculation, we found that the huge temperature variation initiates the expansion and curling of the bulk h-BN. Subseqently, the L-N2 penetrates into the interlayers of h-BN along the curling edge, followed by an immediate drastic gasification of L-N2, further peeling off h-BN. This novel gas exfoliation of high surface area BNNS not only opens up potential opportunities for wide applications, but also can be extended to produce other layered materials in high yields.},

  abstract = {Few-layered boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) have attracted increasing research interest in the past few years due to their unique material properties. However, the lack of a reliable scale-up production method is an inhibiting issue for their practical applications. In this work, we report a facile one-step and high-yield method for the synthesis of few-layered and hierarchically porous BNNSs through simultaneous etching and in situ nitridation of calcium hexaboride (CaB6) by ammonium chloride under moderate conditions. The output of the few-layered BNNSs is as high as 1.4 g with respect to 1.06 g of starting CaB6 crystals. Transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy characterizations confirm the successful synthesis of few-layered BNNSs, most of which are layered with a thickness less than 3 nm (layer number {$<$} 10). The as-prepared BNNSs exhibit a high specific surface area (492\textendash{}795 m2 g-1) and a high pore volume (0.34\textendash{}0.50 cm3 g-1). In addition, the as-resulted BNNSs exhibit high and tuneable H2 uptakes from 1.48 to 2.18 wt\% at 77 K and at a relatively low pressure of 1.0 MPa, thus guiding the further search of materials for H2 storage. Our results suggest that the simultaneous etching and in situ nitridation of metallic borides is a facile and effective method for reliable production of few-layered BNNSs with hierarchical porosity for potential applications such as gas storage and functional composites.},

  abstract = {Two dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (2D-hBN), an isomorph of graphene with a very similar layered structure, is uniquely featured by its exotic opto-electrical properties together with mechanical robustness, thermal stability, and chemical inertness. It is thus extensively studied for application in field effect transistors (FETs), tunneling devices, deep UV emitters and detectors, photoelectric devices, and nanofillers. 2D-hBN is considered as one of the most promising materials that can be integrated with other 2D materials, such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), for the next generation microelectronic and other technologies. Although it is by itself an insulator, it can well be tuned by several strategies in terms of properties and functionalities, such as by doping, substitution, functionalization and hybridization, making 2D-hBN a truly versatile type of functional materials for a wide range of applications. In this review, the distinct structural characteristics of 2D-hBN, doping- and defect-induced variations in energy bands and structures, and resultant properties, are presented. There are a wide variety of processing routes that have been developed for 2D-hBN, including also those for doping, substitution, functionalization and combination with other materials to form heterostructures or h-BNC hybrid nanosheets, which are systematically elaborated for novel functions. The comprehensive overview provides the types of the state-of-the-art 2D-hBN made by new synthesis strategies, where the mainstream approaches include exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition, and gas phase epitaxy, together with several other new methods that have been successfully developed in the past few years. On the basis of the extraordinary electrical and functional properties and thermal\textendash{}mechanical stability, the applications of hBN-based nanosheets as substrates and dielectrics, passivation layers, and nanofillers in nanodevices and nanocomposites are discussed, together with the peculiar optical and wetting characteristics.},

Exfoliated hBN was shown to be stable in solvents such as ethanol, acetone, deionized water and isopropyl alcohol, and this stability was linked to sulfur functionalization that was induced during the exfoliation process. Further evidence of the functionalization was observed using transmission electron spectroscopy (TEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). By deconvoluting the high resolution peaks for B 1s, the bonding of boron to oxygen and sulfur was confirmed. The exfoliated hBN nanosheets were crystalline as confirmed from X-ray diffraction and they also exhibited an optically active defect related to sulfur functionalization at 320 nm (3.9 {$\pm$} 0.1 eV).},

  abstract = {Layered boron nitrides (BNs) are usually viewed as excellent protective coatings and reinforcing materials due to their chemical inertness and high mechanical strength. However, the attention paid to their potential applications in gas sorption, especially in case of hydrogen, has obviously been insufficient. Herein, a novel BN material (i.e., porous microbelts), with the highest specific surface area ever reported for any BN system, up to 1488 m2 g\textendash{}1, is obtained through one-step template-free reaction of a boron acid\textendash{}melamine precursor with ammonia. Comprehensive high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Raman characterizations all confirm that the obtained BN phase is partially disordered, shows an enlarged average spacing between adjacent (0002) layers (d0002 = 0.38 nm, compared to normal 0.33 nm for a bulk layered BN), and belongs to an intermediate state between hexagonal (h-BN) and amorphous (a-BN) phases. By changing the synthesis temperatures, the textures of obtained porous microbelts are adjustable. H2 sorption evaluations demonstrate that the materials exhibit high and reversible H2 uptake from 1.6 to 2.3 wt \% at 77 K and at a relatively low pressure of 1 MPa.},

One example of such an anode\textendash{}electrolyte\textendash{}cathode architecture comprises metallic aluminum, AlCl3:[EMIm]Cl (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride) ionic liquid and graphite. Various forms of synthetic and natural graphite cathodes have been tested in recent years in this context. Here, a new type of compelling cathode based on inexpensive pyrene polymers is demonstrated. During charging, the condensed aromatic rings of these polymers are oxidized, which is accompanied by the uptake of aluminum tetrachloride anions (AlCl4-) from the chloroaluminate ionic liquid. Discharge is the fast inverse process of reduction and the release of AlCl4-. The electrochemical properties of the polypyrenes can be fine-tuned by the appropriate chemical derivatization. This process is showcased here by poly(nitropyrene-co-pyrene), which has a storage capacity of 100 mAh g-1, higher than the neat polypyrene (70 mAh g-1) or crystalline pyrene (20 mAh g-1), at a high discharge voltage ({$\approx$}1.7 V), energy efficiency ({$\approx$}86\%), and cyclic stability (at least 1000 cycles).},

For applications in polymer nanocomposites, chemical exfoliation is a more economically attractive route to few-layer h-BN nanosheets. A thermal oxidation process of h-BN powder could achieve large scale exfoliation and hydroxylated functionalization, as described in prior literature. In this report, hydroxylated h-BN (BNO) was prepared by heating h-BN under air, and then covalently incorporated into epoxy resin modified with (3-isocyanatopropyl)triethoxysilane to prepare epoxy resin (EP) nanocomposites by sol\textendash{}gel process. The structure and morphology of BNO were well characterized. BNO was dispersed in the EP matrix with the form of mainly exfoliated and intercalated structures, and formed strong interfacial interaction with the matrix. Thermogravimetric analysis results revealed that BNO significantly improved thermal stability and thermal oxidative resistance of EP nanocomposites at high temperature. The char yield and the temperature at 50 wt\% mass loss were increased and the maximum mass loss rate was remarkably reduced. Moreover, the addition of 3 wt\% BNO led to extremely high Tg of EP nanocomposite, 42.7 \textdegree{}C higher than that of pure EP, due to improved crosslinking density and confinement effect of BNO sheets on the mobility of polymer networks. Cone calorimeter test results indicated that fire safety properties of EP nanocomposites were also enhanced by the addition of BNO, such as 53.1\% reduction in peak heat release rate and 32.6\% decrease in total heat release, and decreased release of smoke and toxic gases. The mechanism for enhanced fire retardancy is that thermally stable condensed barrier consisting of h-BN sheets and silicon dioxide for heat and mass transfer protects the matrix from further combustion.},

Against this background, the present study deals with the development of a high-thermal-conductivity, low-dielectric-constant, and low-loss polymer nanocomposite based on silver nanoparticle (AgNP)-decorated boron nitride nanosheets (BNNSs) as the filler in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrix. The nanocomposites were prepared through a facile solution-blending process. Elemental mapping of the prepared nanocomposite indicates the uniform distribution of filler particle in PMMA matrix. An impressive high-thermal conductivity (TC) enhancement of around 363\% was achieved for nanocomposite of 0.35 Vf of hybrid filler (1.48 W/m K) compared to pristine PMMA (0.32 W/m K). The addition of AgNP reduces the thermal contact resistance (Rc) by bridging individual BNNS, thereby improving thermal transport. Measured TC values were fitted with a theoretical model that showed good agreement. Dielectric measurements performed at radiofrequencies and microwave frequencies revealed that the nanocomposites show a low dielectric constant ({$<$}5), low loss (10\textendash{}2), and very low alternating current conductivity (10\textendash{}7 S/cm). The results suggest that silver-decorated BNNS is a promising hybrid filler for effective thermal management.},

We consider the ORR in acidic conditions and critically evaluate the performance of unmodified and 2D?hBN modified electrodes, implementing coverage studies (commonly neglected in the literature) in order to ascertain the true impact of this novel nanomaterial. The behaviour of 2D?hBN towards the ORR is shown to be highly dependent upon both the underlying carbon substrate and the coverage/mass utilised. 2D?hBN modified SPEs are found to exhibit the most beneficial response towards the ORR, reducing the peak potential by ca. 0.28?V when compared to an unmodified/bare SPE. Such improvements at this supporting substrate are inferred due to favourable 2D?hBN interaction with ridged surfaces exposing a high proportion of edge regions/sites, where conversely, we show that relatively smooth substrate surfaces (such as GC) are less conducive towards successful 2D?hBN immobilisation. In this paper, we reveal for the first time (in the specific case of using a rough supporting substrate) that 2D?hBN gives rise to beneficial electrochemical behaviour towards the ORR. Unfortunately, this material is not considered an electrocatalyst for use within fuel cells given that the estimated number of electrons transferred during the ORR ranges between 1.90?2.45 for different coverages, indicating that the ORR at 2D?hBN predominantly produces hydrogen peroxide. 2D?hBN does however have potential and should be explored further by those designing, fabricating and consequently electrochemically testing modified electrocatalysts towards the ORR.},

  abstract = {Enthused by the fascinating properties of graphene, we have prepared graphene analogues of BN by a chemical method with a control on the number of layers. The method involves the reaction of boric acid with urea, wherein the relative proportions of the two have been varied over a wide range. Synthesis with a high proportion of urea yields a product with a majority of 1-4 layers. The surface area of BN increases progressively with the decreasing number of layers, and the high surface area BN exhibits high CO2 adsorption, but negligible H2 adsorption. Few-layer BN has been solubilized by interaction with Lewis bases. We have used first-principles simulations to determine structure, phonon dispersion, and elastic properties of BN with planar honeycomb lattice-based n-layer forms. We find that the mechanical stability of BN with respect to out-of-plane deformation is quite different from that of graphene, as evident in the dispersion of their flexural modes. BN is softer than graphene and exhibits signatures of long-range ionic interactions in its optical phonons. Finally, structures with different stacking sequences of BN have comparable energies, suggesting relative abundance of slip faults, stacking faults, and structural inhomogeneities in multilayer BN.},

  abstract = {Abstract A new analogue of graphene containing boron, carbon and nitrogen (BCN) has been obtained by the reaction of high?surface?area activated charcoal with a mixture of boric acid and urea at 900?\textdegree{}C. X?ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron energy?loss spectroscopy reveal the composition to be close to BCN. The X?ray diffraction pattern, high?resolution electron microscopy images and Raman spectrum indicate the presence of graphite?type layers with low sheet?to?sheet registry. Atomic force microscopy reveals the sample to consist of two to three layers of BCN, as in a few?layer graphene. BCN exhibits more electrical resistivity than graphene, but weaker magnetic features. BCN exhibits a surface area of 2911?m2?g?1, which is the highest value known for a BxCyNz composition. It exhibits high propensity for adsorbing CO2 ({$\approx$}100?wt?\%) at 195?K and a hydrogen uptake of 2.6?wt?\% at 77?K. A first?principles pseudopotential?based DFT study shows the stable structure to consist of BN3 and NB3 motifs. The calculations also suggest the strongest CO2 adsorption to occur with a binding energy of 3.7?kJ?mol?1 compared with 2.0?kJ?mol?1 on graphene.},

The morphology and microstructure of the electrode materials were characterized by SEM and TEM, respectively. The energy storage mechanism of aluminum ion batteries was confirmed by ex-situ XPS. It is found that not only AlCl4- but also Al3+ could also be intercalated and deintercalated into the prelithium graphite electrode material. The CV result clearly shows that the Graphite-Li electrode material has two pairs of redox peaks, which can be attributed to the AlCl4- and Al3+ intercalation and deintercalation into the electrode materials, respectively. In addition, the discharge specific capacity of Graphite-Li (68.2 mAh g-1) is significantly higher than Graphite (49.2 mAh g-1) at the currert density of 200 mA g-1. The discharge capacity of Graphite-Li can still reach 64 mAh g-1 even after 500 cycles with a coulombic efficiency close to 100\%. Such remarkable electrochemical performance is attributed to the fact that the interlayer spacing is improved by prelithiation treatment which reduces the electrostatic effect between Al3+ or AlCl4- and electrode materials.},

However, various adsorbates become trapped between layers during their assembly, and this not only affects the resulting quality but also prevents the formation of a true artificial layered crystal upheld by van der Waals interaction, creating instead a laminate glued together by contamination. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has shown that graphene and boron nitride monolayers, the two best characterized 2D crystals, are densely covered with hydrocarbons (even after thermal annealing in high vacuum) and exhibit only small clean patches suitable for atomic resolution imaging6,7,8,9,10. This observation seems detrimental for any realistic prospect of creating van der Waals materials and heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces. Here we employ cross sectional TEM to take a side view of several graphene\textendash{}boron nitride heterostructures. We find that the trapped hydrocarbons segregate into isolated pockets, leaving the interfaces atomically clean. Moreover, we observe a clear correlation between interface roughness and the electronic quality of encapsulated graphene. This work proves the concept of heterostructures assembled with atomic layer precision and provides their first TEM images.},

The search for new battery materials together with the drive to improve performance and lower cost of existing and new batteries is not without its challenges. Success in these matters is undoubtedly based on first understanding the underlying chemistries of the materials and the relations between the components involved. A combined application of experimental and theoretical techniques has proven to be a powerful strategy to gain insights into many of the questions that arise from the ``how do batteries work and why do they fail'' challenge. In this Review, we highlight the application of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in battery research: a technique that can be extremely powerful in characterizing local structures in battery materials, even in highly disordered systems. An introduction on electrochemical energy storage illustrates the research aims and prospective approaches to reach these. We particularly address ``NMR in battery research'' by giving a brief introduction to electrochemical techniques and applications as well as background information on both in and ex situ solid-state NMR spectroscopy. We will try to answer the question ``Is NMR suitable and how can it help me to solve my problem?'' by shortly reviewing some of our recent research on electrodes, microstructure formation, electrolytes and interfaces, in which the application of NMR was helpful. Finally, we share hands-on experience directly from the lab bench to answer the fundamental question ``Where and how should I start?'' to help guide a researcher's way through the manifold possible approaches.},

The investigation was conducted on aluminum rotating disk electrodes as a function of potential, ionic liquid composition, and temperature. Two different dissolution mechanisms were realized. At modest overpotentials, dissolution takes place under mixed kinetic-mass transport control. However, as the overpotential is increased to induce higher dissolution rates and/or the ionic liquid is made more acidic, the dissolution reaction transitions to a potential-independent passivation-like process ascribed to the formation of a porous solid layer of AlCl3(s). At a fixed temperature and composition, the limiting passivation current density displays Levich behavior and also scales linearly with the concentration of AlCl4- in the ionic liquid. The heterogeneous kinetics of the Al dissolution reaction were measured in the active dissolution potential regime. The exchange current densities were independent of the composition of the ionic liquid, and the anodic transfer coefficients were close to zero and seemed to be independent of the Al grain size.},

  abstract = {In this work, non-stoichiometric Cu2-xSe fabricated by a facile water evaporation process is used as high-performance Al-ion batteries (AIBs) cathode material. Cu2-xSe electrodes show high reversible capacity and excellent cycling stability, even at high current density of 200 mA g-1, the specific charge capacity in the initial cycle is 241 mAh g-1 and maintains 100 mAh g-1 after 100 cycles with a Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 96.1\%, showing good capacity retention. The prominent kinetics of Cu2-xSe electrodes is also revealed by the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT), which is attributed to the ultrahigh electronic conductivity of Cu2-xSe material. Most importantly, an extensive research is dedicated to investigating the detailed intercalation and deintercalation of relatively large chloroaluminate anions into the cubic Cu2-xSe, which is conducive to better understand the reaction mechanism of Al/Cu2-xSe battery.},

The dynamic conditions inside a working battery had not been intensively explored until the advent of various in situ characterization techniques. Real-time transmission electron microscopy of electrochemical reactions is one of the most significant breakthroughs poised to enable radical shift in our knowledge on how materials behave in the electrochemical environment. This review, therefore, summarizes the scientific discoveries enabled by in situ transmission electron microscopy, and specifically emphasizes the applicability of this technique to address the critical challenges in the rechargeable ion battery electrodes, electrolyte and their interfaces. New electrochemical systems such as lithium\textendash{}oxygen, lithium\textendash{}sulfur and sodium ion batteries are included, considering the rapidly increasing application of in situ transmission electron microscopy in these areas. A systematic comparison between lithium ion-based electrochemistry and sodium ion-based electrochemistry is also given in terms of their thermodynamic and kinetic differences. The effect of the electron beam on the validity of in situ observation is also covered. This review concludes by providing a renewed perspective for the future directions of in situ transmission electron microscopy in rechargeable ion batteries.},

This raises an interesting problem concerning how the AlCl4 clusters can diffuse so fast in the graphite cathode. In this paper, we first demonstrate by means of density functional theory calculations that AlCl4 cluster exists in graphite with planar quadrangle geometry, rather than a tetrahedral structure. Upon AlCl4 intercalation, the interlayer spacing distance between graphene layers is substantially enlarged from 3.353{\AA} to 6.025{\AA}. With such a large spacing, the AlCl4 diffusion becomes very easy with migration energy barriers ranging from 0.023 to 0.089eV for different migration paths in a 2-dimensional diffusion plane. These results give underlying explanation to the dynamic performance of the graphite-based Al-ion batteries.},

Four deposition methods were tested: doctor blade, Mayer rod, slot die, and low volume low pressure (LVLP) spray. Analytical models that link tooling and process characteristics to mass flow rate of slurry and the resulting dry deposition height are developed and validated experimentally. While all methods successfully produced functioning batteries, a number of different qualitative and quantitative metrics from experimental results identified the best method for both situations. Observations were recorded on adhesion, deposition consistency, usability, and cleanability. Data on specific discharge capacity was recorded to show performance over the anode lifetime and at different charge/discharge rates. The data indicates that anodes produced using reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO) deliver a specific charge storage capacity of 50 to 400 mAh/g at charge-discharge rates of 1C to 0.05C. Doctor blading proved to be best for laboratory setups because of its adjustability, while the Mayer Rod shows promise for high-volume manufacturing due to slight better performance and the use of non-adjustable, dedicated tooling.

  abstract = {Carbonate-based electrolytes used in Li-ion batteries encounter various challenges at extreme electrochemical environments, hence their application calls for the help of various additives, especially when used with high voltage cathode materials. These additives are designed to form protective interphases that prevent parasitic carbonate oxidation, while in certain cases they stabilize electrolytes from reduction at anode surfaces or even serve as flame-retardants that postpone the thermal runaway during overcharge. However, most of these additives are non-solvent to Li-salts, and their excessive use often casts negative effects. An ideal solution of minimizing the presence of these inert molecules is to identify an additive that structurally integrates these multiple functions into a single compound. In this work, we report a novel additive, diethyl (thiophen-2-ylmethyl) phosphonate (DTYP). Its 0.5\% presence in a base electrolyte dramatically improves the capacity retention of a high voltage Li-ion cell using LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 from 18\% to 85\% after 280 cycles at 1 C at 60 oC, raises the endothermic reaction onset temperature from 193 oC to 223 oC, and reduces the self-extinguishing time of the electrolyte from 88 s to 77 s. Thus, such a multifunctional additive presents a cost-efficient solution to the issues often faced in high voltage lithium-ion batteries.},

We explore the influence of the type of anodic material (aluminium, stainless steel and carbon) and its 3D geometry on the reversibility of the anodic reaction by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and galvanostatic charge-discharge. The shape of the CVs confirms that electrodeposition of aluminium was feasible in the three materials but the highest peak currents and smallest peak separation in the CV of the aluminium anode suggested that this material was the most promising. Interestingly, carbon-based substrates appeared as an interesting alternative due to the high peak currents in CV, moderate overpotentials and dual role as anode and cathode. 3D substrates such as fiber-based carbon paper and aluminium mesh showed significantly smaller overpotentials and higher efficiencies for Al reaction suggesting that the use of 3D substrates in full batteries might result in enhanced power. This is corroborated by polarization testing of full Al-batteries.},

In this contribution, the electrochemical intercalation of bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI) anions from an ionic liquid-based electrolyte (Pyr14TFSI) into graphite was studied using ex situ and in situ X-ray diffraction. We prove that the TFSI intercalated graphite exists in a series of staged phases. As for this electrode material the discharge capacity can be strongly influenced by the cut-off potential and temperature, the stage transitions and compositions of the TFSI intercalated graphite were determined in dependency of different temperatures and cut-off potentials. From the experimental data, the periodic repeat distance of the graphite intercalation compound, the TFSI gallery height and the maximum stoichiometries of Cn+TFSI- at these different conditions are calculated and discussed.},

  abstract = {Aluminum-ion batteries (AIBs) are regarded as viable alternatives to lithium-ion technology because of their high volumetric capacity, their low cost, and the rich abundance of aluminum. However, several serious drawbacks of aqueous systems (passive film formation, hydrogen evolution, anode corrosion, etc.) hinder the large-scale application of these systems. Thus, nonaqueous AIBs show incomparable advantages for progress in large-scale electrical energy storage. However, nonaqueous aluminum battery systems are still nascent, and various technical and scientific obstacles to designing AIBs with high capacity and long cycling life have not been resolved until now. Moreover, the aluminum cell is a complex device whose energy density is determined by various parameters, most of which are often ignored, resulting in failure to achieve the maximum performance of the cell. The purpose here is to discuss how to further develop reliable nonaqueous AIBs. First, the current status of nonaqueous AIBs is reviewed based on statistical data from the literature. The influence of parameters on energy density is analyzed, and the current situation and existing problems are summarized. Furthermore, possible solutions and concerns regarding the construction of reliable nonaqueous AIBs are comprehensively discussed. Finally, future research directions and prospects in the aluminum battery field are proposed.},

Considering anatase TiO2 as a model electrode material, it is demonstrated that type of current collector could transform an inactive electrode material to an active one. TiO2 could exhibit initial Al3+ ion storage capacity of 256 mAhg-1 at a current density of 4 Ag-1 with graphite current collector, whereas it is only 82 mAhg-1 with titanium current collector at similar current density.

  abstract = {The development of efficient Al batteries is hindered by the major challenge of finding advanced electrode materials, which can deliver higher voltage and storage capacities with ultra-fast charge/discharge rates. Herein, the first principle calculations are used to comparatively study the cathode applicabilities of 3D C3N bulk, 2D C3N bilayer and 1D C3N nanotubes for Al batteries and to investigate the effect of the dimensions of the cathode on the electrochemical properties of the battery. We observe that all three phases of C3N behave in a similar way to those of the graphite counterpart by initiating the charge transfer from the C3N system to intercalated AlCl4. However, an improved diffusivity and storage capacity are obtained for the 1D C3N nanotubes and 2D C3N bilayer as compared to those for the 3D C3N bulk phase in the Al battery. A detailed discussion of stability vs. voltage for the AlCl4 intercalated systems reveals the fact that the electron-donating ability of the C3N system, when compared to that of graphite, results in stronger binding between AlCl4 and the C3N system, which results in a lower net voltage in the Al battery. In this regard, a 1D electron-deficient system with adequate stability towards AlCl4 intercalation can be a superior choice to obtain high voltage in Al batteries when compared to that obtained by using graphite. We believe that our present study will be helpful in understanding the working mechanism of Al batteries and the development of high-voltage Al battery electrodes with adequate stability.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the relative environmental performance of electrode material candidates for rechargeable aluminum batteries with an AlCl3/EMIMCl (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride) room-temperature ionic liquid electrolyte. To this end, we used a lifecycle environmental screening framework to evaluate 12 candidate electrode materials.

Yet, most existing aluminum-ion research has focused on electrode materials development and synthesis. There has been a lack of fundamental understanding of the electrode processes and thus theoretical guidelines for electrode materials selection and design. In this study, by using density functional theory, we for the first time report a first-principles investigation on the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of aluminum intercalation into two common TiO2 polymorphs, i.e., anatase and rutile. After examining the aluminum intercalation sites, intercalation voltages, storage capacities and aluminum diffusion paths in both cases, we demonstrate that the stable aluminum intercalation site locates at the center of the O6 octahedral for TiO2 rutile and off center for TiO2 anatase. The maximum achievable Al/Ti ratios for rutile and anatase are 0.34375 and 0.36111, respectively. Although rutile is found to have an aluminum storage capacity slightly higher than anatase, the theoretical specific energy of rutile can reach 20.90 Wh kg-1, nearly twice as high as anatase (9.84 Wh kg-1). Moreover, the diffusion coefficient of aluminum ions in rutile is 10-9 cm2 s-1, significantly higher than that in anatase (10-20 cm2 s-1). In this regard, TiO2 rutile appears to be a better candidate than anatase as an electrode material for aluminum-ion batteries.},

Graphene encapsulation prevents "crushed" Al nanoparticles from detaching from the anode, thus allowing prolonged charge-discharge cycling. Graphene also provides surface conduction paths for electrons as well as diffusion paths for Li atoms. For the first time we report the electrochemical room temperature formation of phases such as Li3Al2 and even Li9Al4, with higher Li content than {$\beta$}-LiAl. More interestingly, we observe a progressive change of the composite thin film electrode, switching from a pure galvanic to a pseudo capacitive behavior as the size of the Al grains decreases from \textasciitilde{} 100 nm to 5-10 nm due to repeated Li de-alloying. Capacity values of \textasciitilde{} 900 mAh/g and 780 mAh/g are obtained after respectively 500 and 1000 charge-discharge cycles at 0.1C.

  abstract = {Studies of anode materials due to the rapidly growing demand for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are an active area of research. However, the primary focus is on the specific capacity and cyclability. An essential requirement of electrode materials is the operating voltage, which is defined by the redox potential, but there is a tendency to sacrifice this feature in favor of higher capacities. For the cathode materials, there is a common categorization based on the operating voltage (e.g., high voltage cathode delivering a redox potential between 4.5\textendash{}5.0V vs. Li/Li+), but there is no such categorization for anode materials. The present manuscript aims to provide a general review of the anode material to highlight the importance of the operating voltage for an anode candidate. Furthermore, it is described that compositing the anode materials with carbon nanomaterials can increase the specific capacity for the delithiation, but part of this capacity is due to the carbon capacitance or pseudocapacitance mostly occurring at high potentials, which cannot be gained in the full cell performance. This class of pseudocapacitive anode materials can be of potential interest for energy storage but not appropriate candidates for the conventional LIBs. It is also emphasized that the delithiation process is the main duty of an anode material when a LIB is working.},

Rechargeable aluminium-based batteries offer the possibilities of low cost and low flammability, together with three-electron-redox properties leading to high capacity3. However, research efforts over the past 30 years have encountered numerous problems, such as cathode material disintegration4, low cell discharge voltage (about 0.55 volts; ref. 5), capacitive behaviour without discharge voltage plateaus (1.1\textendash{}0.2 volts6 or 1.8\textendash{}0.8 volts7) and insufficient cycle life (less than 100 cycles) with rapid capacity decay (by 26\textendash{}85 per cent over 100 cycles)4,5,6,7. Here we present a rechargeable aluminium battery with high-rate capability that uses an aluminium metal anode and a three-dimensional graphitic-foam cathode. The battery operates through the electrochemical deposition and dissolution of aluminium at the anode, and intercalation/de-intercalation of chloroaluminate anions in the graphite, using a non-flammable ionic liquid electrolyte. The cell exhibits well-defined discharge voltage plateaus near 2 volts, a specific capacity of about 70 mA h g\textendash{}1 and a Coulombic efficiency of approximately 98 per cent. The cathode was found to enable fast anion diffusion and intercalation, affording charging times of around one minute with a current density of \textasciitilde{}4,000 mA g\textendash{}1 (equivalent to \textasciitilde{}3,000 W kg\textendash{}1), and to withstand more than 7,500 cycles without capacity decay.},

The passive film was composed of particulate FeCl2 with average diameter of about 500~nm. The formation of FeCl2 film was attributed to the variation of the electrolyte Lewis acidity from acidic to neutral at the interface during the dissolution process of Fe.

However, to date, its poor reversibility and low lifespan have limited its practical application. In this paper, a composite cathode is reported for Al\textendash{}S batteries based on S anchored on a carbonized HKUST-1 matrix (S@HKUST-1-C). The S@HKUST-1-C composite maintains a reversible capacity of 600 mAh g-1 at the 75th cycle and a reversible capacity of 460 mAh g-1 at the 500th cycle under a current density of 1 A g-1, with a Coulombic efficiency of around 95\%. X-ray diffraction and Auger spectrum results reveal that the Cu in HKUST-1 forms S\textendash{}Cu ionic clusters. This serves to facilitate the electrochemical reaction and improve the reversibility of S during charge/discharge. Additionally, Cu increases the electron conductivity at the carbon matrix/S interface to significantly decrease the kinetic barrier for the conversion of sulfur species during battery operation.},

We conducted an experimental study of the separators under mechanical loading, and discovered two distinct deformation and failure mechanisms, which could explain the difference in short circuit characteristics of otherwise similar tests. Additionally, by investigation of failure modes, we provided a hypothesis about the process of formation of local ``soft short circuits'' in cells with undetectable failure.

Herein, a novel 3D layered nanoarchitecture network of Ni(HCO3)2/rGO composites with highly uniform Ni(HCO3)2 nanocubes (average diameter of 100 {$\pm$} 20 nm) wrapped in rGO films is facilely fabricated by a one-step hydrothermal self-assembly process based on the electrostatic interaction and coordination principle. Benefiting from the synergistic effects, the Ni(HCO3)2/rGO electrode delivers an ultrahigh capacity (2450 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1), ultrafast rate capability and ultralong cycling stability (1535 mA h g-1 for the 1000th cycle at 5 A g-1, 803 mA h g-1 for the 2000th cycle at 10 A g-1). The detailed electrochemical reaction mechanism investigated by in situ XRD further indicates that the 3D architecture of Ni(HCO3)2/rGO not only provides a good conductivity network and has a confinement effect on the rGO films, but also benefits from the reversible transfer from LiHCO3 to LixC2 (x = 0\textendash{}2), further oxidation of nickel, and the formation of a stable/durable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film (LiF and LiOH), which are responsible for the excellent storage performance of the Li-ions.

However, there are two main barriers before large-scale industrialization, i.e. low initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) and high cost caused by low carbon yield of precursors. In this work, we report a novel commercial activated amorphous carbon-based anode synthesized through a facile-tailored strategy consisting of annealing and surface coating. The as-prepared amorphous carbon has a porous internal structure but a very low specific surface area (SSA) with a dense surface carbon layer. As an anode material for SIBs, the obtained amorphous carbon displays an outstanding electrochemical performance including a high reversible capacity of 391~mAh g-1 at a current density of 25~mA~g-1 with a high ICE of 80\%, and a superior cycling performance with a capacity retention of 97\% after 100 cycles. The high ICE is mainly attributed to the denser surface carbon layer which suppresses the penetration of electrolyte and fully utilizes the internal porosity. The commercial availability, and the desirable properties make this novel amorphous carbon-based anode a promising candidate for SIBs.},

  abstract = {Dual-ion batteries (DIBs) are widely studied as novel electrochemical energy storage devices in view of their low cost, environmental friendliness, and high working voltage. However, the widespread application of these batteries is hindered by organic electrolyte decomposition at high working voltages and the absence of electrode materials allowing for high capacity and long cycle lifetime, which necessitates further investigations toward performance improvement. Herein, we use 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium chloroaluminate (DMPI+)(AlCl4-) as an ionic liquid electrolyte and graphite rods as electrodes to fabricate a DIB with excellent electrochemical performance, revealing that the redox amphotericity of carbon allows the intercalation/deintercalation of both cations and anions into/from the graphite electrodes. The developed DIB is shown to exhibit high discharge voltage plateaus of 4.2\textendash{}4.0 and 3.6\textendash{}3.1 V, a reversible specific capacity of {$\sim$}80 mAh g-1 at a current density of 300 mA g-1, and a high coulombic efficiency of {$\sim$}97\% over 300 cycles. Moreover, the non-flammability and electrochemical stability of the employed electrolyte result in improved safety and performance, allowing the fabricated DIB to function under various critical conditions such as high C-rate charge/discharge, continuous bending, and even burning. Thus, the developed battery is concluded to hold great promise for grid energy storage and other applications.},

Next, we have also studied C59N functionalized with various redox-active oxygen containing functional groups and strongly electron withdrawing functional groups. It is found that the intrinsic electronic structure of the molecule is the major determinant of the redox potential. Our DFT calculations show that the electron affinity to redox potential of functionalized C59N is correlated with the LUMO of the systems very well.

  abstract = {The high electron affinity of fullerene C60 coupled with the rich chemistry of carbon makes it a promising material for cathode applications in lithium-ion batteries. Since boron has one electron less than carbon, the presence of boron on C60 cages is expected to generate electron deficiency in C60, and thereby to enhance its electron affinity. By using density functional theory (DFT), we studied the redox potentials and electronic properties of C60 and C59B. We have found that doping C60 with one boron atom results in a substantial increase in redox potential from 2.462 V to 3.709 V, which was attributed to the formation of an open shell system. We also investigated the redox and electronic properties of C59B functionalized with various redox-active oxygen containing functional groups (OCFGs). For the combination of functionalization with OCFGs and boron doping, it is found that the enhancement of redox potential is reduced, which is mainly attributed to the open shell structure being changed to a closed-shell one. Nevertheless, the redox potentials are still higher than that of pristine C60. From the observation that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of closed-shell OCFG- functionalized C59B is correlated well with the redox potential, it was confirmed that the spin state is crucial to be considered to understand the relationship between electronic structure and redox properties.},

  abstract = {Novel and high-performance anode materials based on modified fullerene materials, for lithium-ion rechargeable batteries were developed. The technical feasibility of lithium-ion intercalation and de-intercalation based on the degree of anion or atomic modification of the fullerene was examined. In this approach the fullerene molecule is viewed as a large anchor molecule to which various anion or atoms can be attached to form C 60 A x , where A could be hydrogen. The lithium-ion intercalation and de-intercalation could be driven by the formation of C 60 AxLix. This could result in anode materials with a potential capacity of {$>$}1200 mAh/g. Fullerenes (mixed C 60 /C 70 , pure C 60 , and pure C 70 ) and hydrogenated fullerenes, both as thin film and as pasted powdered electrode in solid polymer and liquid electrolyte, were investigated. The results of this investigation demonstrated that (1) capacities of a thin film fullerene electrode in a solid polymer electrolyte were found to be low, corresponding to three lithium ions per fullerene molecule, (2) thin film hydrogenated fullerene electrodes resulted in a significant increase in capacity, and lithium-ion intercalation was found to correspond exactly to the degree of hydrogenation of fullerenes, and (3) only certain hydrogenated fullerenes were, surprisingly, found to be effective as high-performance anode materials in liquid electrolyte. Capacities as high as 1100 mAh/g of hydrogenated fullerenes were achieved. This capacity was again found to correspond to the degree of fullerenes hydrogenation of this specific fullerene. In addition, it was found that hydrogenated fullerenes can be added in small quantities to commercial carbon to significantly reduce the irreversible capacity and improve their reversible capacity.},

  abstract = {The superoxide anion radical, O2\textbullet{}-, induced C60 electropolymerization mechanism was refined by simultaneous cyclic voltammetric (CV) and vis-NIR spectroelectrochemical as well as mass spectrometric (MALDI-TOF) characterization of the one- and two-electron reduction products of C60 in the presence of O2 in a mixed organic solvent solution. The C60 polymer (C60-O) film was also investigated by Raman spectroscopy and imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM) both at the early and advanced polymerization stage. While the spectroelectrochemical behavior of the C60/C60\textbullet{}- couple in the presence of O2 was similar to that in its absence, at more negative potentials corresponding to C602- and O2\textbullet{}- formation C602- participated in a chemical follow-up reaction resulting in a product lacking any diagnostic absorption band in the vis-NIR range. Although the main peak in the MS spectrum of the one-electron reduction product was that of C60 at m/z of 720, several additional peaks in the m/z range of 739-760 appeared, indicating generation of C60O\textbullet{}- and C60O2\textbullet{}- followed by their protonation. Interestingly, the MS spectrum of the product of two-electron reduction of C60 revealed several peaks in the m/z range of 1297-1465. These peaks correspond to the oxygen-containing fullerene protonated dimers, which lose the Cn (n = 1, 2) or C2n (n = 2-5) fragments upon ionization. Apparently, products of the C602- and O2\textbullet{}- interaction spontaneously dimerize in the electrode vicinity. Importantly, oxygen is built into the dimeric molecule in the initial stage of electropolymerization. The Raman spectroscopy measurements and AFM surface imaging of the C60-O film revealed that the first CV cycle resulted in an electrodeposition of dimers. With the increase of the number of CV cycles, the extent of polymerization increased and the polymer structure became highly heterogeneous. Finally, an electrophoretically deposited film of the HiPCO single-wall carbon nanotubes (pyr-SWCNTs) noncovalently surface modified with 1-pyrenebutyric acid was coated by electropolymerization with the C60-O film under CV conditions to result in a polymer-CNT composite material. AFM imaging of this film showed that tangles of the pyr-SWCNTs bundles, coated with the C60-O globules, were formed. The electrochemical and viscoelastic properties of the pyr-SWCNTs|C60-O film were unraveled by simultaneously performed CV and piezoelectric microgravimetry (PM) measurements in a blank (TBA)ClO4 acetonitrile solution. Specific capacitance of the electrode coated with this composite film was 184 F g-1, a value comparable to those for other SWNT composite film coated electrodes, suggesting a plausible application of this material in developing supercapacitors.},

  abstract = {The electrochemically active polymers have been formed during electro-reduction carried out in solution containing fullerenes, C60 or C70, and transition metal complexes of Pd(II), Pt(II), Rh(III), and Ir(I). In these films, fullerene moieties are covalently bounded to transition metal atoms (Pd and Pt) or their complexes (Rh and Ir) to form a polymeric network. All films exhibit electrochemical activity at negative potentials due to the fullerene cages reduction process. For all studied metal complexes, yields of formation of films containing C70 are higher than yields of electrodeposition of their C60 analogs. C70 /M films also exhibit higher porosity in comparison to C60/M layers. The differences in film morphology and efficiency of polymer formation are responsible for differences in electrochemical responses of these films in acetonitrile containing supporting electrolyte only. C70/M films shows more reversible voltammeric behavior in negative potential range. They also show higher potential range of electrochemical stability. Processes of film formation and electrochemical properties of polymers depend on the transition metal ions or atoms bonding fullerene cages into polymeric network. The highest efficiency of polymerization was observed for fullerene/Pd and fullerene/Rh films. In the case of fullerene/Pd films, the charge transfer processes related to the fullerene moieties reduction in negative potential range exhibit the best reversibility among all of the studied systems. Capacitance performances of C60/Pd and C70/Pd films deposited on the porous Au/quartz electrode were also compared. Capacitance properties of both films are significantly affected by the conditions of electropolymerization. Only a fraction of the film having a direct contact with solution contributes to pseudocapacitance. Capacitance properties of these films also depend on the size of cations of supporting electrolyte. The C70/Pd film exhibits much better capacitance performance comparison to C60/Pd polymer.},

Based on the reaction mechanisms, lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries have a high specific capacity of 1672 mAh/g, with a theoretical energy density up to 2600 Wh/Kg. However, the sulfur cannot serve as cathode individually because of its isolation nature and soluble compounds, which necessitates a second component as a conducting matrix and sulfur host. Thus, sulfur cathodes have diversified through microstructure designing with various materials, including inorganic compounds, polymers, carbon materials, and their hybrids, which should be satisfied several essential requirements, such as high stable incorporation with sulfur, high electrical conductivity of electrode materials, and loose framework to suffer the volume expansion of cathode during charge-discharge process. These investigations may provide the effective routes to prepare different new cathode materials with unique structures and morphologies for Li-S batteries, which improve cycling stability, coulombic efficiency, and rate capacity of the electrode at higher current density.},

  volume = {1},
  abstract = {Li\textendash{}S battery is one of the most promising next-generation rechargeable battery technologies because of its high theoretical energy density and low material cost. However, its success is impeded by the low energy efficiency and fast capacity fade primarily caused by the discharge intermediates, Li-polysulfides (PS), dissolution in the electrolyte. Mitigation of PS dissolution in electrolyte involves the search for a new electrolyte solvent system that exhibits poor solvation to the PS while still having good solvation ability to the electrolyte salt for high ionic conductivity. Applying cosolvents with reduced solvating power but compatible with the state of the art Li\textendash{}S battery's ether-based electrolyte is one of the most promising concepts. This route is also advantageous of having a low scale-up cost. With the aid of quantum chemical calculation, we have identified high carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio ethers as cosolvent in the new electrolytes that effectively impede PS dissolution while still maintaining high ionic conductivity. Significantly improved cycle life and cycling Coulombic efficiency are observed for Li\textendash{}S cells using the new composite electrolytes. Anode analysis with different methods also demonstrate that reducing electrolyte's PS solubility results in less sulfur total amount on the lithium anode surface and lower ratio of the longer-chain PS, which is probably a sign of suppressed side reactions between the anode and PS in the electrolyte.},

The C60 polymer (C60-O) film was also investigated by Raman spectroscopy and imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM) both at the early and advanced polymerization stage. While the spectroelectrochemical behavior of the C60/C60\textbullet{}- couple in the presence of O2 was similar to that in its absence, at more negative potentials corresponding to C602- and O2\textbullet{}- formation C602- participated in a chemical follow-up reaction resulting in a product lacking any diagnostic absorption band in the vis-NIR range. Although the main peak in the MS spectrum of the one-electron reduction product was that of C60 at m/z of 720, several additional peaks in the m/z range of 739-760 appeared, indicating generation of C60O\textbullet{}- and C60O2\textbullet{}- followed by their protonation. Interestingly, the MS spectrum of the product of two-electron reduction of C60 revealed several peaks in the m/z range of 1297-1465. These peaks correspond to the oxygen-containing fullerene protonated dimers, which lose the Cn (n = 1, 2) or C2n (n = 2-5) fragments upon ionization. Apparently, products of the C602- and O2\textbullet{}- interaction spontaneously dimerize in the electrode vicinity. Importantly, oxygen is built into the dimeric molecule in the initial stage of electropolymerization. The Raman spectroscopy measurements and AFM surface imaging of the C60-O film revealed that the first CV cycle resulted in an electrodeposition of dimers. With the increase of the number of CV cycles, the extent of polymerization increased and the polymer structure became highly heterogeneous. Finally, an electrophoretically deposited film of the HiPCO single-wall carbon nanotubes (pyr-SWCNTs) noncovalently surface modified with 1-pyrenebutyric acid was coated by electropolymerization with the C60-O film under CV conditions to result in a polymer-CNT composite material. AFM imaging of this film showed that tangles of the pyr-SWCNTs bundles, coated with the C60-O globules, were formed. The electrochemical and viscoelastic properties of the pyr-SWCNTs|C60-O film were unraveled by simultaneously performed CV and piezoelectric microgravimetry (PM) measurements in a blank (TBA)ClO4 acetonitrile solution. Specific capacitance of the electrode coated with this composite film was 184 F g-1, a value comparable to those for other SWNT composite film coated electrodes, suggesting a plausible application of this material in developing supercapacitors.},

Additionally, both the structure configuration and chemical components of the current collectors have also great impact on the rate capability and cycling stability, implying that the 3D BDC networks are more favorable to offer promoted energy storage capability. Implication of the results from suggests that the carbon-based current collectors and all-carbon positive electrodes are able to deliver more advantages in energy storage behaviors in comparison with the traditional positive electrodes with metal Mo current collectors.

We confirmed the part of the cathode capacity was contributed by AlCl4- deposition, and the reaction mechanism of our new system resulted from the special structure of EG, which served as an important supplement of the classical mechanism of AIB. The high capacity of EG-AIB was contributed by AlCl4- deposition and its stage 4 intercalation.

  abstract = {Performance degradation over Li-ion battery lifetime is unavoidable and ultimately rooted in chemical processes. Their extent is mostly determined by battery material components and operation conditions (charge/discharge rates, voltage operation limits and temperature) and can also be influenced by battery design. The two major factors contributing to loss of negative electrode performance are the instability of the passivation layer formed at the electrode/electrolyte interface (enhanced at higher temperatures) and lithium metal plating (intensified at low temperatures). In contrast, capacity fading at the positive electrode mostly results from partial dissolution of the active material during cycling/storage or electrolyte solvent oxidation, which is promoted by temperature and high potential. While it would be most useful to be able to monitor degradation at all levels while the cell is being cycled, the feasibility of this approach remains limited, and most approaches involve accelerated testing with ante/post mortem characterization. Yet, the use of suitable protocols for battery opening and disassembling is crucial to avoid biased interpretation. Finally, the relevance of degradation diagnosis coupled to modelling is also worth mentioning.},

Owing to its low cost, high-rate capability, excellent cyclability, and non-flammability, AIB provides a safe alternative to many commercial batteries used in the energy storage system. To improve its performance, identifying molecular structure and arrangement of chloroaluminate anion (AlCl4-) intercalated in the graphite layer remains a great challenge. In this work, operando analysis of X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement and X-ray absorption (XAS) spectroscopy were performed to investigate the intercalation of AlCl4- anion and related molecular arrangement in the graphite layers. The intercalated stage and intercalant gallery height of graphite cathode electrode during AIB battery operation were observed to be stage 3 and 9.22 {\AA}, respectively. Furthermore, the spectral evolution from ex-situ XAS at the Al and Cl K-edge was associated with closely packed intercalation of AlCl4- molecules. With density functional theory (DFT) calculation, three simulated models of intercalated AlCl4- molecules in the graphite layer were revealed successfully, which explained possible molecular structures at different charging states.

Despite the enticing aspects regarding cost and energy density, the poor reversibility of electrodes has limited the pursuit of RABs for a long time. Fortunately, ionic-liquid electrolytes enable reversible aluminum plating/stripping at room temperature, and they lay the very foundation of RABs. In order to integrate with the aluminum-metal anode, the selection of the cathode is pivotal, but is limited at present. The scant option of a reliable cathode can be accounted for by the intrinsic high charge density of Al3+ ions, which results in sluggish diffusion. Hence, reliable cathode materials are a key challenge of burgeoning RABs. Herein, the main focus is on the insertion cathodes for RABs also termed aluminum-ion batteries, and the recent progress and optimization methods are summarized. Finally, an outlook is presented to navigate the possible future work.},

Herein, a flexible unzipped multi-walled carbon nanotubes (UCNTs) film consisting of graphene nanoribbons and a carbon nanotube backbone is prepared via a simple, low-cost and scalable method for high-performance aluminum battery positive electrode. In the nanostructure, the neonatal graphene nanoribbons provide numerous active intercalation sites to store AlCl4- anions, while the internal core CNTs are responsible for the rapid transportation of electrons to the active sites. Fast transportation of electrons and anions in UCNT film are simultaneously achieved, promoting the kinetics in the aluminum battery. Thus the UCNT-Al battery exhibits a high storage performance with a capacity as high as 100 mA h g-1 (current density: 2000 mA g-1) and a long cycle life of 5600 cycles with a capacity of 75 mA h g-1 (Coulombic efficiency: 98\%) at 5000 mA g-1. Furthermore, the excellent flexibility and fast charging and variable discharging performance are beneficial for the development of portable devices. This work effectively tackles bottleneck caused by the lack of active sites for CNT-based aluminum batteries and accelerates the development of aluminum batteries.},

However, lithium dendrite growth and infinite volume change during reduplicative plating/stripping processes induce the security issue, low coulombic efficiency and poor cycle performance of lithium metal batteries. Here, with high tensile strength, elasticity and good chemical resistance, glass fiber films are employed as a three-dimensional host of lithium metal anode, on which, golden nanoparticles are coated by cool sputtering to direct the planiform deposition of lithium. Thanks to the effective suppression of lithium dendrite growth, a stable and reversible lithium metal anode is achieved with an average coulombic efficiency of 98.1\% over 400 cycles in ether-based electrolyte (at a current density of 1 mA cm-2 for a total of 1 mAh cm-2 of lithium). Besides, compared with carbon nanofiber films which the voltage hysteresis increased drastically after 50 cycles, glass fiber films exhibit more stable cyclic performance over 200 cycles. Furthermore, a full battery when it is coupled the anode with lithium iron phosphate shows enhanced rate capability and high cycle stability with retention of 95.6\% at 2C over 150 cycles, which demonstrates a promising high-energy and safe rechargeable lithium metal battery.},

This limitation is addressed through the use of graphene-based positive electrodes which can improve the rate capability of these batteries due to their higher conductivity. However, conventional methods of graphene production induce a significant number of defects which impair the performance of AIBs and DIBs. Herein, we report the use of a defect free graphene positive electrode which was produced using electrochemical exfoliation of graphite in an aqueous solution with the aid of Co2+ as an antioxidant. The Co-treated graphene electrode achieved a high capacity of 150 mAh g-1 in DIBs and 130 mAh g-1 in AIBs with high rate capability for both batteries. The charge-discharge mechanism of the batteries is examined using in situ Raman spectroscopy and the results revealed that the intercalation density of [AlCl4] or [PF6] increased from a dilute staging index graphite intercalation compound (GIC) to a stage 1 GIC within the operating voltage window. The simple production method of high-quality graphene in conjunction with its high performance in DIBs should enable the use of graphene for DIB technologies.},

  abstract = {The stability of modern lithium-ion batteries depends critically on an effective solid\textendash{}electrolyte interphase (SEI), a passivation layer that forms on the carbonaceous negative electrode as a result of electrolyte reduction. However, a nanoscopic understanding of how the SEI evolves with battery aging remains limited due to the difficulty in characterizing the structural and chemical properties of this sensitive interphase. In this work, we image the SEI on carbon black negative electrodes using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and track its evolution during cycling. We find that a thin, primarily amorphous SEI nucleates on the first cycle, which further evolves into one of two distinct SEI morphologies upon further cycling: (1) a compact SEI, with a high concentration of inorganic components that effectively passivates the negative electrode; and (2) an extended SEI spanning hundreds of nanometers. This extended SEI grows on particles that lack a compact SEI and consists primarily of alkyl carbonates. The diversity in observed SEI morphologies suggests that SEI growth is a highly heterogeneous process. The simultaneous emergence of these distinct SEI morphologies highlights the necessity of effective passivation by the SEI, as large-scale extended SEI growths negatively impact lithium-ion transport, contribute to capacity loss, and may accelerate battery failure.},

This raises an interesting problem concerning how the AlCl4 clusters can diffuse so fast in the graphite cathode. In this paper, we first demonstrate by means of density functional theory calculations that AlCl4 cluster exists in graphite with planar quadrangle geometry, rather than a tetrahedral structure. Upon AlCl4 intercalation, the interlayer spacing distance between graphene layers is substantially enlarged from 3.353{\AA} to 6.025{\AA}. With such a large spacing, the AlCl4 diffusion becomes very easy with migration energy barriers ranging from 0.023 to 0.089eV for different migration paths in a 2-dimensional diffusion plane. These results give underlying explanation to the dynamic performance of the graphite-based Al-ion batteries.},

  abstract = {Aluminum battery offers a new possibility for low cost and large-scale stationary storage of electricity because it can be made with cheap materials and exhibits high theoretical mass specific capacity and power density. Among many cathodic materials, graphite/graphene may be one of the most promising cathode materials for aluminum-ion battery. A suitable three-dimensional structure of the cathode is an important factor for the high performance of battery. In this paper, a binder-free cathode is prepared by dropcasting small ultrasonicated graphite flakes (u-GF) on carbon fiber cloth (CFC) which provides a three-dimensional network skeleton for the new cathode. Al|EMImCl-1.3AlCl3|u-GF@CFC battery exhibits a high discharge specific capacity of \textasciitilde{}140 mAh g-1 at 100  mA g-1. The battery has good rate performance and cycling stability: the capacity still exceeds 100 mAh g-1 at 600 mA g-1 with a high coulomb efficiency of 98\% and maintains 60 mAh g-1 at 3000 mA g-1 over 300 cycles.},

  abstract = {Raman spectroscopy is one of the most valuable experimental techniques for quality assessment and structural characterization of sample materials. As such, it has been applied to understand the mechanism of the staging of anions and cations into graphite-based electrodes in a variety of energy storage devices such as Al batteries, dual-ion cells, and Li-ion batteries. However, the correlation between the Raman peaks and intercalation stages is still unclear in most of these systems. This is due to the fact that the modeling of electron-phonon coupling in highly doped graphite systems is beyond the standard Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Here, we simulate the Raman peaks for AlCl-4-intercalated graphite in Al batteries by using a nonadiabatic coupling theory. Specifically, we successfully correlate the Raman peaks of the G phonon in AlCl-4-doped graphite with experiment for intercalation stages 1, 2, and 4, while stage 3 appears to be absent. Stages 1 and 2 have not been observed in experimental XRD patterns. We therefore believe that the AlCl-4-graphite intercalation compound has a core-shell structure with a maximum stage of 4 or 3 in the core and 2 or 1 in the shell. In addition, the observed intense narrow Raman bands for the Al-ion battery cathode are due to the high level of graphite doping and are explained in terms of low electron-phonon decay rates.},

  abstract = {In this study, we synthesized an excellent ternary graphene-based carbon coated SnO2 (rGO/PC/SnO2) nanocomposite anode for lithium ion batteries (LIBs), in which carbon-coated SnO2 nanoparticles homogeneously grow on the surface of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) using glucose as the soft templating agent. Using glucose can limit the growth of the SnO2 particles; as a result, the size of the SnO2 particles would be relatively uniform. Moreover, the carbon coated on the surface of SnO2 particles can effectively prevent their agglomeration on the surface of rGO and limit their volume expansion during charge\textendash{}discharge cycles. The porous structure of the rGO/PC/SnO2 nanocomposite can effectively accommodate the severe volume variation upon cycling and provide additional contact areas between the active material and the electrolyte. Significantly, the rGO/PC/SnO2 anode delivers an initial specific discharge capacity of 2238.2 mA h g-1 and retains 1467.8 mA h g-1 after 150 cycles at a current density of 0.1C (1C = 782 mA g-1). Even at the high specific current of 1C after 200 cycles, the reversible specific capacity is still as high as 618.3 mA h g-1. The rGO/PC/SnO2 anode exhibits excellent rate performances and possesses a reversible specific capacity of 445.9 mA h g-1 at 5C implying its good structural stability.},

Herein, we successfully achieve the growth of single-crystalline metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) in three-dimensional (3D) ordered macroporous template voids by saturated solution-based double-solvent-assisted strategy with precise control over the nucleation process. The as-prepared single-crystalline ordered macro-microporous Co-based MOFs (SOM ZIF-67) exhibits an ordered macro-microporous structure with robust single crystalline nature. Moreover, SOM ZIF-67 can serve as precursor to derive 3D ordered macroporous cobalt diselenide@carbon (3DOM CoSe2@C) through a facile carbonization-selenization treatment. The as-derived 3DOM CoSe2@C can well preserve the 3D ordered macroporous structure of the precursor. More importantly, CoSe2 nanoparticles could be uniformly confined in the conductive ordered macroporous carbon framework, affording regularly interconnected microporous channels and large surface area. As a result, when evaluated as a cathode material for aluminumion batteries, the ordered macroporous structure could not only effectively facilitate the diffusion of large-sized chloroaluminate anions, but also increase contact area with electrolyte and provide more exposed active sites, thereby exhibiting superior reversible rate capacity (86 mA h g-1 at 5.0 A g-1) and remarkable cycling performance (125 mA h g-1 after 1000 cycles at 2.0 A g-1).},

LiPF6 and LiClO4 dissolved in ethylene carbonate:diethylene carbonate (1:1) were used as the electrolyte to study irreversible charge capacity of CB cathodes when cycled between 4.9 V and 2.5 V. Synchrotron-based soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SOXPES) results revealed spontaneous partial decomposition of the electrolytes on the CB electrode, without applying external current or voltage. Depth profile analysis of the electrolyte/cathode interphase indicated that the concentration of decomposed species is highest at the outermost surface of the CB. It is concluded that carboxylate and carbonate bonds (originating from solvent decomposition) and LiF (when LiPF6 was used) take part in the formation of the decomposed species.

  abstract = {C60 fullerene crystals may serve as important catalysts for interstellar organic chemistry. To explore this possibility, the electronic structures of free-standing powders of C60 and (C59N)2 azafullerenes are characterized using X-ray microscopy with near-edge X-ray adsorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy, closely coupled with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This is supported with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements and associated core-level shift DFT calculations. We compare the oxygen 1s spectra from oxygen impurities in C60 and C59N, and calculate a range of possible oxidized and hydroxylated structures and associated formation barriers. These results allow us to propose a model for the oxygen present in these samples, notably the importance of water surface adsorption and possible ice formation. Water adsorption on C60 crystal surfaces may prove important for astrobiological studies of interstellar amino acid formation.},

The hydrophilic nature of hemp shiv, a plant based aggregate, results in composites having poor interfacial adhesion, weak mechanical properties and long drying times. In this work, sol-gel process has been utilised to manufacture durable low density hemp based composites. Morphological characterisation by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that hemp shiv was embedded well in the matrix. Detailed chemical analysis using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) indicate the presence of water soluble and ethanol soluble extractives leached from the hemp shiv which are incorporated into the silica matrix inducing the binding effect. The composites were water resistant and showed good mechanical performance having the potential to develop novel thermal insulation building materials.},

This research news summarizes the recent advances in improving the supercapacitor performance of carbonaceous materials, including the incorporation of heteroatoms and the pore size effect (subnanopores' contribution). In addition, a new class of carbonaceous materials, porous organic networks (PONs) has been managed into the supercapacitor field, which promises great potential in not only improving the supercapacitor performances, but also unraveling the related mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-RGO) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) have been synthesized by microwave-assisted hydrothermal method to discern the actual contribution of nitrogen-containing functional groups on the specific capacitance (CS,T) in acidic and alkaline electrolytes. Material characterization reveals similar porosity, electrolyte-accessible surface area, element composition, and graphitic crystallinity between N-RGO and RGO except the difference in the nitrogen content. In 1~M H2SO4, additional pseudocapacitance provided by pyridinic-N and pyrrolic-N/pyridone-N is clearly observed at the potential negative to 0.6~V (vs. RHE) while this contribution in pseudocapacitance diminishes in 1~M KOH due to the lack of proton in the electrolyte for these basic functional groups to undergo redox reactions. The double-layer capacitance of N-RGO in 1~M H2SO4 in higher than that in 1~M KOH owing to the presence of N-containing functional groups which increase the electronic charge density of graphene and favor proton adsorption in the acidic electrolyte. The contribution of nitrogen-containing functional groups on CS,T in acidic media is more pronounced than that in the alkaline electrolyte. This finding is crucial for the future application of N-doped carbons in supercapacitors to achieve full utilization.},

For low surface area conductive blacks, the electrical conductivity correlates well with the surface chemistry.

The relative intensities and the energy positions for the core-level satellites have been determined. For C60, a comparison of the low energy {$\pi$} type shake-up satellites gives good agreement between theory and experiment. Also, the energies of these features for fullerene and glassy carbon are very similar, whereas the corresponding energies for HOPG are somewhat larger, presumably, because of the higher density of the latter. Moreover, the atomic force microscopy (AFM) study indicates that the C60 samples consist of a thick layer of large clusters on the Si(111) surface, which is in line with the molecular character of the XPS spectrum. Furthermore, the broad high energy satellite does not consist of a single plasmon but of many components due to collective excitations characteristic of molecules and solids.

It has a capacity retention of 85\% after nearly 10,000 cycles. After characterizing the anode, it was determined that the high reversibility of the Fe to FeCl2 solid state transformation are responsible for the absence of dendritic growth on such a metal anode. Different electrode capacity matching strategies are discussed in the context of ensuring safe operation during overcharging.

  abstract = {Graphene is of great significance in energy storage devices. However, a graphene-based electrode is difficult to use in direct applications due to the large surface area and flexibility, which leads to the excessive consumption of electrolyte, low Coulombic efficiency, and electrode shedding behaviors. Herein, a special crystal carbon@graphene microsphere (CCGM) composite was successfully synthesized. The scalable carbonaceous microsphere composite displays a small specific surface area and a superior structure stability. As a potassium ion battery electrode in a half-cell, CCGM delivers an initial capacity of 297.89 mAh g\textendash{}1 with a high Coulombic efficiency of about 99\%. It achieves an excellent cyclic stability with no capacity loss after 1250 cycles at the low current density of 100 mA g\textendash{}1 with a long performing period of more than one year. As the cathode for an aluminum battery, a reversible specific capacity of 99.1 mAh g\textendash{}1 at 1000 mA g\textendash{}1 is obtained. CCGM delivers a long cycle performance of about 10 000 cycles at 4000 mA g\textendash{}1 with a capacity retention of nearly 100\%. Our design provides a fresh thought for the improvement of graphene-based materials, and it will greatly facilitate the application of graphene in the field of energy storage.},

Nevertheless, the scarcity of suitable cathode materials with satisfactory rate performance and cycling stability hinders its further development and wider field of application. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for designing a novel two-dimensionally porous Co9S8 nanosheets as the cathode materials for AIBs. The electrode exhibits an outstanding electrochemical performance with an excellent cycling stability (maintains 120 mAh g-1 after 250 cycles at 0.2 A g-1) and enchanced rate performance (60 mAh g-1 at 2 A g-1 and can quickly recover to 120 mAh g-1 when the current density is reduced back to 0.1 A g-1). Furthermore, high capacity retentions and superior stability for the assembled soft-pack batteries can also be achieved under high and low temperatures and stringent bending conditions. The remarkable aluminum storage behavior of the engineered Co9S8 cathode is attributed to its unique two dimensional (2D) geometrical architecture, abundant internal porosity and nanosized secondary building blocks. Our findings appear to provide a potential new avenue in the design of cathode materials in AIBs.},

Among all the proposed non-lithium-based battery systems, rechargeable aluminum-ion batteries (RAIBs) are considered as a promising candidate due to aluminum's abundance and safety. Naturally, exploring compatible and high-performance cathode materials for RAIBs becomes a key issue for pushing RAIBs from lab-level to industrialization. In this work, we report a novel high-performance RAIB system using MOF-derived Co3O4@MWCNTs polyhedron composite as cathode. The well-defined morphology of MOF-derived Co3O4 and enhancement brought by MWCNTs allow Co3O4@MWCNTs polyhedrons to deliver an initial discharge capacity of ca. 266.3 mAh g-1, and the reversible specific capacity can reach to 125 mAh g-1 at 100 mA g-1 over 150 cycles. The energy storage mechanism has been verified to be a reversible valence-change reaction between Co3O4 and Co.

Many researchers inevitably choose ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC) as the electrolyte as they observe superior electrochemical performances compared to other solvents. Here, we clarify the underlying reason why EMC is better. Specifically, EMC forms a thinner layer of cathode electrolyte interface on the graphite surface with fewer Li-F and ROCO2Li species than that with dimethyl carbonate and diethyl carbonate. EMC electrolyte reduces charge-transfer resistance, polarization and self-discharge of graphite electrodes. It also enhances Coulombic efficiency, cycle and rate performances, allowing 90\% of the capacity to be available from graphite even at 12 C (1200 mA g-1). Our work also emphasizes the importance of electrolyte and electrolyte-interface on future developments of DIBs.},

  abstract = {The expansion of renewable energy and the growing number of electric vehicles and mobile devices are demanding improved and low-cost electrochemical energy storage. In order to meet the future needs for energy storage, novel material systems with high energy densities, readily available raw materials, and safety are required. Currently, lithium and lead mainly dominate the battery market, but apart from cobalt and phosphorous, lithium may show substantial supply challenges prospectively, as well. Therefore, the search for new chemistries will become increasingly important in the future, to diversify battery technologies. But which materials seem promising? Using a selection algorithm for the evaluation of suitable materials, the concept of a rechargeable, high-valent all-solid-state aluminum-ion battery appears promising, in which metallic aluminum is used as the negative electrode. On the one hand, this offers the advantage of a volumetric capacity four times higher (theoretically) compared to lithium analog. On the other hand, aluminum is the most abundant metal in the earth's crust. There is a mature industry and recycling infrastructure, making aluminum very cost efficient. This would make the aluminum-ion battery an important contribution to the energy transition process, which has already started globally. So far, it has not been possible to exploit this technological potential, as suitable positive electrodes and electrolyte materials are still lacking. The discovery of inorganic materials with high aluminum-ion mobility\textemdash{}usable as solid electrolytes or intercalation electrodes\textemdash{}is an innovative and required leap forward in the field of rechargeable high-valent ion batteries. In this review article, the constraints for a sustainable and seminal battery chemistry are described, and we present an assessment of the chemical elements in terms of negative electrodes, comprehensively motivate utilizing aluminum, categorize the aluminum battery field, critically review the existing positive electrodes and solid electrolytes, present a promising path for the accelerated development of novel materials and address problems of scientific communication in this field.},

  abstract = {Understanding the factors limiting Li+ charge transfer kinetics in Li-ion batteries is essential in improving the rate performance, especially at lower temperatures. The Li+ charge transfer process involved in the lithium intercalation of graphite anode includes the step of de-solvation of the solvated Li+ in the liquid electrolyte and the step of transport of Li+ in the preformed solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on electrodes until the Li+ accepts an electron at the electrode and becomes a Li in the electrode. Whether the de-solvation process or the Li+ transport through the SEI is a limiting step depends on the nature of the interphases at the electrode and electrolyte interfaces. Several examples involving the electrode materials such as graphite, lithium titanate (LTO), lithium iron phosphate (LFP), lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA) and solid Li+ conductor such as lithium lanthanum titanate or Li-Al-Ti-phosphate are reviewed and discussed to clarify the conditions at which either the de-solvation or the transport of Li+ in SEI is dominating and how the electrolyte components affect the activation energy of Li+ charge transfer kinetics. How the electrolyte additives impact the Li+ charge transfer kinetics at both the anode and the cathode has been examined at the same time in 3-electrode full cells. The resulting impact on Li+ charge transfer resistance, Rct, and activation energy, Ea, at both electrodes are reported and discussed.},

Herein, an aluminum-selenium (Al-Se) battery that operates at room temperature with high energy efficiency is reported. This Al-Se battery exhibits high selenium utilization with a discharge capacity of 607 mAh g-1, a reduced overpotential, and high volumetric capacity for over 100 cycles. Furthermore, ex-situ spectroscopic and microscopic investigations of the Se cathodes indicated the existence of an aluminum selenide component as the discharge product. Additionally, in-situ transmission electron microscopy provided not only insights into understanding the Al-Se electrochemistry, but also a real-time characterization technique to evaluate the electrochemistry of AIBs in general.},

  abstract = {We present a wide range of testing results on an excellent moderate-energy-density lithium-ion pouch cell chemistry to serve as benchmarks for academics and companies developing advanced lithium-ion and other ``beyond lithium-ion'' cell chemistries to (hopefully) exceed. These results are far superior to those that have been used by researchers modelling cell failure mechanisms and as such, these results are more representative of modern Li-ion cells and should be adopted by modellers. Up to three years of testing has been completed for some of the tests. Tests include long-term charge-discharge cycling at 20, 40 and 55\textdegree{}C, long-term storage at 20, 40 and 55\textdegree{}C, and high precision coulometry at 40\textdegree{}C. Several different electrolytes are considered in this LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2/graphite chemistry, including those that can promote fast charging. The reasons for cell performance degradation and impedance growth are examined using several methods. We conclude that cells of this type should be able to power an electric vehicle for over 1.6 million kilometers (1 million miles) and last at least two decades in grid energy storage. The authors acknowledge that other cell format-dependent loss, if any, (e.g. cylindrical vs. pouch) may not be captured in these experiments.},

A method for engineering a stable 1T phase from the 2H phase in a scalable manner and an in-depth electrical characterization of the 1T phase is wanting at large. Here we demonstrate a controllable and scalable 2H to 1T phase engineering technique for MoS2 using microwave plasma. Our method allows lithographically defining 1T regions on a 2H sample. The 1T samples show excellent temporal and thermal stability making it suitable for standard device fabrication techniques. We conduct both two-probe and four-probe electrical transport measurements on devices with back-gated field effect transistor geometry in a temperature range of 4\,K to 300\,K. The 1T samples exhibit Ohmic current-voltage characteristics in all temperature ranges without any dependence to the gate voltage, a signature of a metallic state. The sheet resistance of our 1T MoS2 sample is considerably lower and the carrier concentration is a few orders of magnitude higher than that of the 2H samples. In addition, our samples show negligible temperature dependence of resistance from 4\,K to 300\,K ruling out any hoping mediated or activated electrical transport.},

  abstract = {Chemically and mechanically exfoliated MoS2 single-layer samples have substantially different properties. While mechanically exfoliated single-layers are monophase(1H polytype with Mo in trigonal prismatic coordination), the chemically exfoliated samples show coexistence of three different phases, 1H, 1T (Mo in octahedral coordination), and 1T{${'}$} (a distorted 2\texttimes{}1 1T superstructure). By using first-principles calculations, we investigate the energetics and the dynamical stability of the three phases. We show that the 1H phase is the most stable one, while the metallic 1T phase, strongly unstable, undergoes a phase transition towards a metastable and insulating 1T{${'}$} structure composed of separated zigzag chains. We calculate electronic structure, phonon dispersion, Raman frequencies, and intensities for the 1T{${'}$} structure. We provide a microscopical description of the J1, J2, and J3 Raman features that were first detected more than 20 years ago but have remained unexplained up to now. Finally, we show that H adsorbates, which are naturally present at the end of the chemical exfoliation process, stabilize the 1T{${'}$} over the 1H one.},

  abstract = {In recent years, a rechargeable aluminum-ion battery based on ionic liquid electrolyte is being extensively explored due to three-electron electrochemical reactions, rich resources, and safety. Herein, a rechargeable Al-ion battery composed of MoS2 microsphere cathode, aluminum anode, and ionic liquid electrolyte has been fabricated for the first time. It can be found that Al3+ intercalates into the MoS2 during the electrochemical reaction, whereas the storage mechanisms of the electrode material interface and internal are quite different. This result is confirmed by ex situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction etching techniques. Meanwhile, this aluminum-ion battery also shows excellent electrochemical performance, such as a discharge specific capacity of 253.6 mA h g\textendash{}1 at a current density of 20 mA g\textendash{}1 and a discharge capacity of 66.7 mA h g\textendash{}1 at a current density of 40 mA g\textendash{}1 after 100 cycles. This will lay a solid foundation for the commercialization of aluminum-ion batteries.},

  abstract = {Strategies are presented to enhance operating potential and cycle life of AC/AC capacitors using salt aqueous electrolytes. Li2SO4 (pH = 6.5) allows 99\% efficiency to be exhibited at 1.6 V cell potential with low self-discharge, while in BeSO4 (pH = 2.1) efficiency is low (81\%). Li2SO4 performs better due to high di-hydrogen over-potential at the negative electrode and related pH increase in AC porosity. When stainless steel current collectors are used in Li2SO4, the cell resistance suddenly increases after 12 hours floating at 1.6 V, due to corrosion of the positive collector. With nickel negative and stainless steel positive collectors, the electrode potentials are shifted by -105 mV at cell potential of 1.6 V, allowing stable cell parameters (capacitance, resistance) and reduction of corrosion products formation on positive steel collector after 120 hours floating. Phenanthrenequinone was grafted on activated carbon to get an additional faradaic contribution in buffer solutions (pH = 4.0 or 7.2). The three-electrode cell CVs show that the redox peaks of the phenanthrenequinone graft shift toward negative values when pH increases from 4 to 7.2. The grafted carbon displays a capacitance value of 194 F g-1 at pH = 4.0 as compared to 82 F g-1 for the as-received carbon.},

A description is provided here of the common methods of self-discharge study: half cell vs. full cell measurements and open-circuit potential decay versus float currents. A description of some of the models used to evaluate faradaic self-discharge is presented, with a synopsis of the important aspects of the many available charge redistribution models. An overview of the current self-discharge mechanisms for various ECs is provided, highlighting that for many systems there are significant factors of the self-discharge process which remain unknown.

  abstract = {Electrical energy storage (EES) is one of the most critical areas of technological research around the world. Storing and efficiently using electricity generated by intermittent sources and the transition of our transportation fleet to electric drive depend fundamentally on the development of EES systems with high energy and power densities. Supercapacitors are promising devices for highly efficient energy storage and power management, yet they still suffer from moderate energy densities compared to batteries. To establish a detailed understanding of the science and technology of carbon/carbon supercapacitors, this review discusses the basic principles of the electrical double-layer (EDL), especially regarding the correlation between ion size/ion solvation and the pore size of porous carbon electrodes. We summarize the key aspects of various carbon materials synthesized for use in supercapacitors. With the objective of improving the energy density, the last two sections are dedicated to strategies to increase the capacitance by either introducing pseudocapacitive materials or by using novel electrolytes that allow to increasing the cell voltage. In particular, advances in ionic liquids, but also in the field of organic electrolytes, are discussed and electrode mass balancing is expanded because of its importance to create higher performance asymmetric electrochemical capacitors.},

The effect becomes only apparent when capacitors are polarized to voltages at or above specified limits, or at high temperatures, for at least several months. A combination of ``post mortem'' analysis methods shows that the pores in the carbon are modified structurally, mainly by clogging up with organic species, but also electrochemically by decomposition of electrolyte, and by reduction and oxidation of the carbon in the electrodes. Key chemicals are trace water, the solvent acetonitrile, and the salt tetraethyl ammonium tetrafluoroborate. The changes differ hugely between negative and positive pole; the positively polarized electrode is much more affected. Also other compounds of the device, e.g. aluminum electrode support and paper separator, exhibit chemical ageing.},

The development by Sony was carried out within a few years by bringing together technology in film coating from their magnetic tape division and electrochemical technology from their battery division. The past 25 years has shown rapid growth in the sales and in the benefits of lithium ion in comparison to all the earlier rechargeable battery systems.

Studying the effect of the pore size on capacitance could potentially improve performance by maximizing the electrode surface area accessible to electrolyte ions, but until recently, no studies had addressed the lower size limit of accessible pores. Using carbide-derived carbon, we generated pores with average sizes from 0.6 to 2.25 nanometer and studied double-layer capacitance in an organic electrolyte. The results challenge the long-held axiom that pores smaller than the size of solvated electrolyte ions are incapable of contributing to charge storage.

Raman and X-ray diffraction following 1000 cycles demonstrates no signature of defects, damage, or change to graphitic crystallinity compared to uncycled pristine materials that is attributed to weak ion\textendash{}lattice interactions due to the solvated guest K ions. In situ Raman spectroscopy highlights the sequential formation of a stage 4, 3, 2, and 1 graphite intercalation compound (GIC) that occurs without the signature of dilute staging. In a charged stage 1 compound, we observe lattice expansion from 0.335 nm to 1.16 nm and measure the work function to be {$\sim$}3.4 eV.

Hence there is a `driving force', corresponding to the free energy of discharge, tending to spontaneously diminish the charge if some mechanism(s) of self-discharge exist. An ideally polarizable (chargeable) capacitor has no self-discharge or current-leakage pathway and hence can remain charged indefinitely. However, practical capacitors, like batteries, suffer appreciable self-discharge over periods of days or months so that this phenomenon is of major interest in evaluation of capacitor performance and choice of materials to minimize self-discharge. Several mechanisms of self-discharge are distinguished and the resulting forms of the change of potential on open-circuit with time or log time provide a means of identifying the type of self-discharge process that occurs.

  abstract = {Certain microporous carbons have pores of molecular dimensions, the size of which can be adjusted over a wide range to fit the dimensions of a large variety of molecules. With knowing the dimensions of these molecules, size-calibrated porous carbons can be produced. In this work, we took advantage of the electronic conductivity of carbon in using it as an electrode in electrolytic solutions. By changing the electrode potential, we could induce electroadsorption and electrodesorption of ions of different dimensions into pore-calibrated carbons, thus enabling us to estimate effective ion sizes. A few fundamental questions such as whether ions accommodated in the electrodes' pores are in a solvated state, which is important for novel electrochemical energy storage devices and for microbiological systems, could be addressed. Analysis of the results indicates that all the cations that are employed are electroadsorbed in the electrode pores in hydrated states. Compared with the monovalent cations, the bivalent cations exhibit dimensions that make them almost twice as big. Monovalent anions are basically adsorbed in a nonhydrated state. The doubly charged sulfate anion is adsorbed in the hydrated state. The nitrate, a multiatom planar anion, has a smaller effective dimension than the monoatomic halogen anions, in accordance with the observation that the pores in many activated carbons are slit-shaped. The analysis of the results enabled us to establish a scale of ionic effective dimensions in aqueous media, as presented below (MTBE stands for methyl tert-butyl ether):\, cations, [3.62 {\AA}, N2] {$<$} Cs+ {$<$} K+ {$<$} Na+ {$<$} Li+ {$<$} [4.21 {\AA}, CF4] {$<$} [5.05 {\AA}, SF6] {$<$} [5.8 {\AA}, MTBE] {$<$} Ba2+, Ca2+, and Mg2+; anions, [3.62 {\AA}, N2] {$<$} NO3- {$<$} Cl- {$<$} F- {$<$} Br- {$<$} [4.21 {\AA}, CF4] {$<$} ClO4- {$<$} [5.05 {\AA}, SF6] {$<$} [5.8 {\AA}, MTBE] {$<$} SO2-.

  abstract = {The electrochemical storage of energy in various carbon materials (activated carbons, aerogels, xerogels, nanostructures) used as capacitor electrodes is considered. Different types of capacitors with a pure electrostatic attraction and/or pseudocapacitance effects are presented. Their performance in various electrolytes is studied taking into account the different range of operating voltage (1 V for aqueous and 3 V for aprotic solutions). Trials are undertaken for estimating the role of micro and mesopores during charging the electrical double layer in both kinds of electrolytic solutions for which the electrical conductivity and the size of solvated ions are different. The effect of pseudocapacitance for maximising the total capacitance is especially documented. Carbons chemically modified by a strong oxidation treatment represent a very well defined region of pseudocapacitance properties due to the Faradaic redox reactions of their rich surface functionality. Conducting polymers (polyaniline, polypyrrole, polythiophene derivatives) and oxidised metallic particles (Ru, Mn, Co,\ldots{}) deposited on the carbons also participate in the enhancement of the final capacity through fast faradaic pseudocapacitance effects. Evaluation of capacitor performance by different techniques, e.g. voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy, charge/discharge characteristics is also discussed.},

  abstract = {In this paper an adaptive energy management strategy (EMS) based on fuzzy logic and the optimal sizing for a tramway with a hybrid energy storage system (ESS) combining batteries (BT) and supercapacitors (SC) are presented. The EMS applies a sliding window to estimate the forward energy consumption and adapt the instantaneous power target for BT and SC. The hybrid ESS sizing is obtained by an optimization with multi-objective genetic algorithms (GA). The fitness functions are expressed in economic terms, and correspond to the costs of the energy absorbed from the catenary as well as the operation cost of the hybrid ESS (investment and cycling cost). The selected case study is the tramway of Seville, which operates in zones with and without catenary. The aim is to minimize the daily operating cost of the tramway taking into account the BT and SC degradation approach (cycling) and fulfilling the performance of the tramway in the catenary-less zone. The proposed approach (adaptive EMS and optimal sizing) is compared with the current solution in the tramway (SC-based) and with a hybrid ESS managed by a rule-based EMS (RB-EMS) in terms of daily operating cost and energy harnessing during regenerative braking phase. The proposed approach show cost reductions up to 25.5\% (from SC-based), 6.2\% (from hybrid ESS with RB-EMS) and a global efficiency around 84.4\%.},

The current collectors and active layers are printed with graphite and activated carbon inks, respectively, and aqueous NaCl used as the electrolyte. The devices are characterized through galvanostatic discharge measurements for quantitative determination of capacitance and equivalent series resistance (ESR), as well as impedance spectroscopy for a detailed study of the factors contributing to ESR. The capacitances are 200\textendash{}360 mF and the ESRs 7.9\textendash{}12.7 {$\Omega$}, depending on the layer thicknesses. The ESR is found to be dominated by the resistance of the graphite current collectors and is compatible with applications in low-power distributed electronics.

  issn = {1463-9084},
  abstract = {Spontaneous voltage drop between EDLC electrodes, when it is kept under the open-circuit condition, is commonly called `self-discharge' and is interpreted as a result of energy loss by the device. Three mechanisms of self-discharge were proposed: due to a leakage-current, faradaic reactions and charge redistribution. According to the law of energy preservation, if the voltage drop is associated with the energy loss, the energy would more likely be exchanged with the environment. While heat generation was measured during EDLC charging and discharging, the corresponding effect during storage under open-circuit conditions has not been reported. This may support the conclusion that voltage changes during `self-discharge' are not related to a considerable energy loss. Moreover, it has been shown that a two-stage charging process, i.e. first galvanostatic charging followed by a potentiostatic charge redistribution, resulted in considerably slower potential changes when the device was switched to the open circuit. All discussed models were based on the assumption that the energy accumulated by EDLCs is proportional to the voltage in the second power, with capacitance (C/2) as the proportionality constant. However, it has been shown that during EDLC charging or discharging through a resistance R, equations valid for `dielectric' and electrolytic capacitors, do not hold in the case of EDLCs. Consequently, the assumption that the energetic state of the EDLC is proportional at any time to the voltage in the second power may not be valid due to considerable variability of the `constant' C. Therefore, voltage changes may not reflect the energetic state of the device.},

The morphology and structure of graphene sheets were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).

The first reversible specific capacity of the prepared graphene sheets was as high as 1264mAhg-1 at a current density of 100mAg-1.

After 40 cycles, the reversible capacity was still kept at 848mAhg-1 at the current density of 100mAg-1.

  abstract = {Carbon materials, owing to their excellent electrical conductivity, tailorability, inexpensiveness and versatility, have been extensively studied as electrode materials for supercapacitors. The capacitance of carbon-based supercapacitor electrodes has remained at a mediocre level between 100 and 200 F g-1 for decades. Until recently, a new family of carbon materials termed hierarchical porous carbons has pushed the capacitance to new benchmark values beyond 300 F g-1, and has revitalized the exploration of carbon materials for supercapacitors. Hierarchical porous carbons contain different scales of pores (from micropores to macropores) inter-connected together and assembled in hierarchical patterns. Experimental studies coupled with theoretical investigations have elucidated that the presence of micropores is responsible for offering a large surface area to enhance charge storage capability, whilst mesopores, macropores and the hierarchical structure improve electrolyte infiltration and facilitate ion diffusion. This review will start by introducing different pore types and the definition of hierarchical porous structures, followed by discussion and exemplification of major synthesis strategies. In addition, recent molecular-level understanding of the relationship between pore size, functionalities inside pores, pore spatial distribution and capacitive performance is presented. Finally, challenges and future opportunities associated with hierarchical porous carbons for supercapacitors are discussed.},

The electrochemical properties of (Ru-Ti)Ox aerogels, RuO2, and hydrous RuO2 are examined by direct pressing of sub-milligram quantities of the solid onto the surface of a conductive carbon/wax composite. Voltammetric measurements in acidic electrolyte confirm a pseudocapacitive response for all the RuOx-based materials. Despite an improvement in BET surface area, as compared with other RuO2 materials, the (Ru-Ti)Ox aerogel displays a low specific capacitance, which correlates to the high degree of crystallinity of the aerogel. Nanocrystallites of rutile RuO2, formed during thermal treatment of the sol-gel Ru/Ti precursors, deleteriously affect the specific capacitance of the material; however, all RuOx domains in the aerogel are voltammetrically addressable. The influence of proton-donating species on the observed capacitance for the (Ru-Ti)Ox aerogel is evident from the dependence of the voltammetric charge in acidic electrolyte on the potential scan rate.},

In particular, with large surface area, high porosity, low density, good directionality, and tunable composition, electrospun nanofibers and mats are regarded as ideal candidates for various kinds of electrochemical energy storage devices such as supercapacitors (SCs). In this review, the recent progress in electrospun electrode materials for SCs is presented, covering the architecture design and their electrochemical performance. After a brief introduction about SCs, the basic principles of the electrospinning technique are discussed. Following, attention is paid to the discussion of various electrospun nanofibers and mats including 1D carbons, metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal nitrides, conducting polymers and composite nanomaterials with various types of architectures as electrodes for SCs. The relationship between the composition, architecture, and the electrochemical performance is discussed in detail. Finally, some challenges and perspectives of future research of the electrospun nanofibers and mats for high performance SCs are highlighted. It is anticipated that this review would provide the researchers some inspiration for constructing new types of energy storage devices.},

  abstract = {Problems, which may arise when low-temperature nitrogen adsorption is used for the characterisation of porous materials, are discussed in this review. Continuous or discontinuous manometric techniques can be employed for nitrogen adsorption measurements at 77 K. For pore structure analysis, the nitrogen adsorption\textendash{}desorption isotherms should be determined over the widest possible range of relative pressure, while allowing for slow equilibration and other operational problems, particularly at very low pressures. In spite of its artificial nature, the Brunauer\textendash{}Emmett\textendash{}Teller (BET) method is still used for the determination of surface area. In principle, nitrogen isotherms of Types II and IV are amenable to BET analysis provided that pores of molecular dimensions are absent and that the BET plot is obtained over an appropriate range of the isotherm. An empirical method based on the application of standard adsorption data is useful for checking the validity of the BET-area. All the computational procedures for pore size analysis have limitations of one sort or another. The various assumptions include an ideal pore shape, rigidity of the structure and an oversimplified model (capillary condensation or micropore filling). The derived pore widths and pore volumes should be regarded as effective (or apparent) values with respect to the adsorption of nitrogen at 77 K.},

The lowest electrical volume resistivity and highest compressibility were found for C-NERGY\texttrademark{} Super C45 dry-mixed with LiCoO2 powder. Mixing by high shear forces in acetone dispersion improved the electrical resistivity and compressibility of the C-NERGY\texttrademark{} Super C65 containing LiCoO2 mixture to the same level obtained for the C-NERGY\texttrademark{} Super C45 mixture in the same process. Acetone dispersions of C-NERGY\texttrademark{} Super C45 and LiCoO2 showed the lowest viscosities attributed to the carbon black's specific BET surface area of 45m2g-1 being the lowest of all carbon blacks studied. The easy dispersibility of C-NERGY\texttrademark{} Super C45 in LiCoO2 could be explained by its particular surface group chemistry characterized by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry. The electrical volume resistivity of the LiCoO2/carbon black mixtures was in line with the high current rate performance of half-cells with related LiCoO2 electrodes. Compared to the investigated carbon blacks, the electrical volume resistivity of the graphite conductive additives C-NERGY\texttrademark{} KS6L and C-NERGY\texttrademark{} SFG6L at different concentrations in LiCoO2 powders showed higher critical volume fractions but lower ultimate resistivity levels. Adding one of these graphites to the carbon black conductive mass improved the electrode density and, at concentrations above the critical volume fraction of the graphite component, significantly decreased the ultimate resistivity level of the LiCoO2 electrode mass.},

  abstract = {Power improvement in supercapacitors is mainly related to lowering the internal impedance. The real part of the impedance at a given frequency is called ESR (equivalent series resistance). Several contributions are included in the ESR: the electrolyte resistance (including the separator), the active material resistance (with both ionic and electronic parts) and the active material/current collector interface resistance. The first two contributions have been intensively described and studied by many authors. The first part of this paper is focused on the use of surface treatments as a way to decrease the active material/current collector impedance. Al current collector foils have been treated following a two-step procedure: electrochemical etching and sol-gel coating by a highly-covering, conducting carbonaceous material. It aims to increase the Al foil/active material surface contact leading to lower resistance. In a second part, carbon-carbon supercapacitor impedance is discussed in term of complex capacitance and complex power from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data. This representation permits extraction of a relaxation time constant that provides important information on supercapacitor behaviour. The influence of carbon nanotubes addition on electrochemical performance of carbon/carbon supercapacitors has also been studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.},

First, the cyclic voltammetry data established that only a thin layer of MnO2 is involved in the redox process and electrochemically active. Second, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data revealed that the manganese oxidation state was varying from III to IV for the reduced and oxidized forms of thin film electrodes, respectively, during the charge/discharge process. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy data also show that Na+ cations from the electrolyte were involved in the charge storage process of MnO2 thin film electrodes. However, the Na/Mn ratio for the reduced electrode was much lower than what was anticipated for charge compensation dominated by Na+, thus suggesting the involvement of protons in the pseudofaradaic mechanism. An important finding of this work is that, unlike thin film electrodes, no change of the manganese oxidation state was detected for a thicker composite electrode because only a very thin layer is involved in the charge storage process.},

  abstract = {The lithium storage properties of graphene nanosheet (GNS) materials as high capacity anode materials for rechargeable lithium secondary batteries (LIB) were investigated. Graphite is a practical anode material used for LIB, because of its capability for reversible lithium ion intercalation in the layered crystals, and the structural similarities of GNS to graphite may provide another type of intercalation anode compound. While the accommodation of lithium in these layered compounds is influenced by the layer spacing between the graphene nanosheets, control of the intergraphene sheet distance through interacting molecules such as carbon nanotubes (CNT) or fullerenes (C60) might be crucial for enhancement of the storage capacity. The specific capacity of GNS was found to be 540 mAh/g, which is much larger than that of graphite, and this was increased up to 730 mAh/g and 784 mAh/g, respectively, by the incorporation of macromolecules of CNT and C60 to the GNS.},

This paper reviews recent progress in the research and development of ES electrolytes. The electrolytes are classified into several categories, including: aqueous, organic, ionic liquids, solid-state or quasi-solid-state, as well as redox-active electrolytes. Effects of electrolyte properties on ES performance are discussed in detail. The principles and methods of designing and optimizing electrolytes for ES performance and application are highlighted through a comprehensive analysis of the literature. Interaction among the electrolytes, electro-active materials and inactive components (current collectors, binders, and separators) is discussed. The challenges in producing high-performing electrolytes are analyzed. Several possible research directions to overcome these challenges are proposed for future efforts, with the main aim of improving ESs' energy density without sacrificing existing advantages (e.g., a high power density and a long cycle-life) (507 references).},

Two-electrode supercapacitor cells constructed with this carbon yielded high values of gravimetric capacitance and energy density with organic and ionic liquid electrolytes.

They are very attractive candidates for efficient electrochemical energy storage systems because of their unique physicochemical properties, such as conductivity, mechanical and thermal stability, and cyclability. In this review, we aim to provide a systematic summary of the synthesis, modification, and electrochemical performance of nanostructured Sn-based compounds, as well as their energy storage applications in lithium/sodium-ion batteries (LIB/SIB), and supercapacitors.

This study demonstrates that rationally designing a 3D cross-stacked carbon fiber composite layer as the current collector is an efficient and effective ``two-in-one'' strategy to reduce the entire electrode mass and provide a long cycling stability with no electrochemical corrosion. Moreover, the electrode connects closely with carbon fiber composite layer, which shows considerable cell performance, strong mechanical, and more importantly, light in weight (2.5 mg cm-2). According to the electrochemical measurements, high reversible capacity of 95 mAh g-1 is obtained at a rate of 1 C. Implication of the results from suggests that all-carbon positive electrodes are able to deliver more advantages in energy storage behaviors in comparison with the traditional positive electrodes of metal Mo current collectors. Such novel strategy promises a new route for fabricating high-performance positive electrodes for stable advanced aluminum batteries.},

  abstract = {Adjusting the hydrogen-binding free energy ({$\Delta$}GH*) of two dimensional (2D) MoS2 by changing the interlayer distance has been an effective strategy to improve the intrinsic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a facile solvothermal access via various ratio of N, N-dimethylformamide (DMF)/H2O has been used to modulate interlayer distance of nanostructured MoS2. With increasing of DMF, the interlayer distance of MoS2 can be expanded to 9.4{\AA} with smaller sizes, which may be derived from intercalation effect of DMF. The certain ratio of DMF/H2O (volume ratio of 19/1, MoS2-D19H1) leads to the largest interlayer distances of 10.0{\AA} and the smallest size of nanospheres with less stacking than counterparts synthesized at other ratios of DMF/H2O. The expanded interlayer distance of MoS2-D19H1 may change electronic structure of active sites for HER, implying the improved {$\Delta$}GH* and the intrinsic activity of MoS2. The smallest size also suggests the more exposure of active sites for HER. The electrochemical measurements demonstrate that MoS2-D19H1 shows the best electrocatalytic performances than MoS2 samples synthesized at other ratio of DMF/H2O. This work may provide a promising strategy to tune the interlayer distance of 2D-layered transition metal dichalcogenide for efficient HER.},

Surface composition determined using quantitative X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) showed that the surfaces of the as received fibers and the water washed fibers were predominantly lignin and extractives and only after NaOH treatments was there sufficient oxygen on the surface to allow for the presence of polysaccharides.

This is due to several challenging issues related to a massive volume expansion during operation. Nanostructured electrodes can accommodate the volume expansion but typically suffer from cumbersome synthesis routes and associated problems regarding scalability and cost efficiency, preventing their commercialization. Herein, a facile, easily scalable, and highly cost-efficient fabrication route is proposed based on electroplating and subsequent electrolytic oxidation of tin, resulting in additive-free tin oxide anodes for lithium-ion batteries. The electrodes prepared accordingly exhibit excellent performance in terms of gravimetric and volumetric capacity as well as promising cycle life and rate capability, making them suitable for future high-energy lithium-ion batteries.},

However, there has not yet been a comprehensive study on its structure and electrochemical properties for Li/Na ion uptake, though it is important to characterize its contribution in any study of active materials that uses this additive in non-negligible amounts. In this article the structure of SPCB has been characterized and a comprehensive study on the electrochemical Li/Na ion uptake capability and reaction mechanisms are reported. SPCB exhibits a considerable lithiation capacity (up to 310 mAh g\textendash{}1) from the Li ion intercalation in the graphite structure. Sodiation in SPCB undergoes two stages: Na ion intercalation into the layers between the graphene sheets and the Na plating in the pores between the nano-graphitic domains, and a sodiation capacity up to 145 mAh g\textendash{}1 has been achieved. Moreover, the influence of the type and content of binders on the lithiation and sodiation properties has been investigated. The cycling stability is much enhanced with sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC) binder in the electrode and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) in the electrolyte; and a higher content of binder improves the Coulombic efficiency during dis-/charge.},

However, a series of issues will need to be addressed for the commercialization of AIBs. Anodic dissolution of cheap materials commonly used as cathode current collectors is a great challenge. At laboratory scale, this issue is solved by using expensive/scarce current collectors. The aim of our work is twofold. 1) To quantify the impact of the current collector in the battery cost by performing a cost analysis, which reveals that the current collector is currently the most expensive element in AIBs. 2) To propose the use of carbon-based current collectors, such as gas diffusion layers (GDLs), which are shown to be an excellent option for AIBs. From an electrochemical perspective, the GDL does not corrode and does not catalyze electrolyte decomposition. Moreover, performances of AIBs using GDLs as current collectors are comparable to those using more expensive state-of-the-art materials, while its use contributes to reducing battery costs.},

However, the various intermediate conversion and alloy reactions taking place during lithiation/delithiation, as well as the electrolyte stability, have not been fully elucidated, and many ambiguities remain. An amorphous SnO2 thin film was investigated for use as a model electrode by a combination of postmortem X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy supported by density functional theory calculations and scanning electron microscopy to shed light on these different processes. The early stages of lithiation reveal the presence of multiple overlapping reactions leading to the formation of Li2SnO3 and Sn0 phases between 2 and 0.8 V vs Li+/Li. Between 0.45 V and 5 mV vs Li+/Li Li8SnO6, Li2O and LixSn phases are formed. Electrolyte reduction occurs simultaneously in two steps, at 1.4 and 1 V vs Li+/Li, corresponding to the decomposition of the LiPF6 salt and ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate solvents, respectively. Most of the reactions during delithiation are reversible up to 1.5 V vs Li+/Li, with the reappearance of Sn0 accompanied by the decomposition of Li2O. Above 1.5 V vs Li+/Li, Sn0 is partially reoxidized to SnOx. This process tends to limit the conversion reactions in favor of the alloy reaction, as also confirmed by the long-term cycling samples.},

This dislocation cloud indicates large in-plane misfit stresses and is a structural precursor to electrochemically driven solid-state amorphization. Because lithiation-induced volume expansion, plasticity, and pulverization of electrode materials are the major mechanical effects that plague the performance and lifetime of high-capacity anodes in lithium-ion batteries, our observations provide important mechanistic insight for the design of advanced batteries.

Here we share insights into how control of the five main crystallographic features (two transition-metal ions, the inserting ion, defects, and water) imparts control over the ion-insertion reaction. We then identify five key opportunities to expand our understanding of these materials, including the role of water in their ion conduction, modeling, synthesis methods, use as anode materials, and technoeconomics.

The aliovalent ion doping may present an effective way to improve the electrochemical performances of MoO3. Here, it is shown, by first-principle calculations, that doping MoO3 with V by 12.5\% can modulate significantly electronic structure and provide a small diffusion barrier for enhancing the electrochemical performance of MoO3. The ultralong Mo0.88V0.12O2.94 nanostructures, which retain the h-MoO3 structure and present an exceptionally high conductivity and fast ionic diffusion due to the substitution of V, facilitating lithiation/delithiation behavior, and induce a fine nanosized structure with a reduced volume change are prepared. As a result, the stress and strain are alleviated during the Li-ion intercalation/deintercalation processes, improving the cycling stability and rate capability. Such a large improvement in the electrochemical properties can be ascribed to the stabilizing effect of V, the small migration energy barrier, and short diffusion path, which arise from the introduction of V into MoO3.

After an intercalation/deintercalation cycle the original host lattice may be retained practically unchanged if the structure of the host matrix is determined by strong covalent bonds and if the concentration of intercalated ions was small. On the other hand, high concentration of unsolvated Li+ ions in fairly ionic oxide host lattices such as MoO3, Cr2O5 or Cr3O8 (CrOx) cause significant irreversible structural and also morphological changes of the host matrix. Moreover, ternary oxides LinMOx prepared at room temperature are non-equilibrium phases \textemdash{} their structural parameters and transport properties vary with conditions of preparation, ageing time etc., and elevated temperature finally causes a complete and irreversible breakdown of their original structure. Prolonged cycling of crystalline large particle size MoO3 leaves quasi-amorphous powders which, however, are still usable for rechargeable cathodes. Failure of LinMoO3 and LinCrOx electrodes is due to recrystallization via solution, forming e.g. Li2MoO4 from LinMoO3. To obtain a better understanding of the limitations of MoO3 and CrOx cathodes under practical operation conditions changes in structure and morphology during electrochemical and chemical lithiation and after electrochemical cycling were followed by X-ray diffraction and SEM micrographs; supplementary results were obtained by electrochemical methods and by thermal analysis. Electronically conducting preparations of ``hexagonal MoO3'' (which is a hydrated MoO3 modification) were also characterized with respect to their discharge behaviour and reversibility in organic Li+-electrolytes - their ``sloping'' discharge characteristics disqualify them for practical applications.},

The addition of Li to C3N4 results in a reaction between the Li and the graphite-like C3N species in C3N4. This irreversible reaction leads to the formation of Li-CH=NR and Li-N=CR2 species, which are detrimental to anode properties. Suitable nitrogen-doped carbon structures for anode applications are predicted to need high concentrations of pyridinic C\textendash{}N\textendash{}C terminal bonds and low concentrations of quaternary C3N species to boost electronic conductivity and reversibly cycle Li ions.},

Nanostructured materials such as nano-carbons, alloys, metal oxides, and metal sulfides/nitrides have been used as anodes for next-generation LIBs with high reversible capacity, fast power capability, good safety, and long cycle life. This is due to their relatively short mass and charge pathways, high transport rates of both lithium ions and electrons, and other extremely charming surface activities. In this review paper, the effect of the nanostructure on the electrochemical performance of these anodes is presented. Their synthesis processes, electrochemical properties, and electrode reaction mechanisms are also discussed. The major goals of this review are to give a broad overview of recent scientific researches and developments of anode materials using novel nanoscience and nanotechnology and to highlight new progresses in using these nanostructured materials to develop high-performance LIBs. Suggestions and outlooks on future research directions in this field are also given.},

The unique properties are due to the high density of Li ions firmly adsorbed over nitrogen triangular holes. The gravimetric and volumetric densities of hydrogen in Li2C3N4 and Li2C4N3 are greater than 10 wt \% and 100 g/L, respectively, both exceeding the target set by the U.S. Department of Energy. Similarly, single-layer Li2C3N4 is a good candidate for a lithium-ion anode material with a specific capacity almost twice that of graphite, and bulk LiC4N3 can be used as a cathode material with a specific energy twice that of LiCoO2. The materials have the added advantage that they are stable against clustering of Li and are nontoxic.},

A thorough mixing of these slurries poses a major challenge in the battery manufacturing process. Several types of mixing devices and mixing methods were examined. The conventional turbine stirrers or ball mill mixers could be adequately used for the preparation of anode slurries, but not suitable for cathode slurries. In this study, a newly three-dimensional mixer, in conjunction with a multi-stage mixing sequence was proposed. The mixing effectiveness was examined by means of rheological measurements and flow visualization techniques. Preliminary electrical performance results indicated that the battery obtained using the 3D mixing device with a multi-stage mixing sequence was more efficient to those obtained from conventional methods.},

The process uses a water-based slurry to cast the electrodes, using poly vinylidene-fluoride (PVDF) as a polymeric binder. The use of aqueous PVDF latex as a binder in positive electrodes is of difficult integration in existing production lines due to the low stability of lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) in an aqueous environment. The use of electroless plating solves this issue by coating LiCoO2 particles with a copper-based layer stable to water. The presence of copper on the surface of the powders is confirmed by means of SEM, XRF and conductivity measurements of the powders. Electrochemical characterization of the electrodes has been carried out with cycling tests in coin cells, confirming the cycling stability during charge/discharge cycles. Cycling performances of the water-based cathodes containing coated active material particles are comparable to a reference NMP-based cathode, while uncoated particles show a sensibly lower capacity retention during cycling. The possibility of up-scaling the metallization process has been tested with the use of a semi-industrial pilot filter dryer.},

The electronic conductivity of the AB/PVDF composites at different compositions was measured with a four-point probe direct current method. The electronic conductivity was found to increase rapidly and plateau at an AB:PVDF ratio 0.2:1 (by weight), with 0.8:1 being the highest conductivity composition. AB:PVDF compositions along the plateau of 0.2:1, 0.4:1, 0.6:1, and 0.8:1 were investigated. Electrodes of each of those compositions were fabricated with different fractions of AB/PVDF to active material. It was found that at the 0.8:1 AB:PVDF, the rate performance improved with increases in the AB/PVDF loading, whereas at the 0.2:1 AB:PVDF, the rate performance improved with decreases in the AB/PVDF loading. The impedance of electrodes made with 0.6:1 AB:PVDF was low and relatively invariant.},

The former process gives the slurry that is more suitable for electrode preparation with fluid-like behavior and more uniform dispersion of solid ingredients as compared to those prepared from the letter. In the composite electrode prepared from the former, the LiCoO2 and carbon particles are homogeneously distributed without agglomeration. Indebted to this favorable feature, this electrode exhibits a better electrochemical performance for cyclability and rate capability. It is very likely that the contact resistance and charge transfer resistance for lithiation/de-lithiation are smaller in the former electrode due to the homogeneous distribution of LiCoO2 and carbon particles, which leads to a less significant electrode polarization.},

Here, we report a systematic investigation on ASSBs fabricated by a solution-based casting process. By screening a wide range of binders and solvents, acrylonitrile butadiene rubber and para-xylene were a suitable binder and solvent, respectively, compatible with sulfide glass-ceramic solid electrolyte. This binder-solvent combination facilitates homogeneous dispersion of the solid electrolyte in the slurry and electrolyte layer, offering high adhesion between electrode materials and comparable lithium ionic conductivity to that of the dry mixing-based counterpart. When solution-based casting processes were adopted for both electrolyte and composite cathode (containing LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2) layers, the solution-processed cell exhibits decent performance in rate capability and cyclability due to higher homogeneity of the electrode components, originating from the appropriate combination of solvent and binder.},

Testing of lithium-ion batteries in an academic setting has taken on several forms, but at the most basic level lies the coin cell construction. In traditional LIB electrode preparation, a multi-phase slurry composed of active material, binder, and conductive additive is cast out onto a substrate. An electrode disc can then be punched from the dried sheet and used in the construction of a coin cell for electrochemical evaluation. Utilization of the potential of the active material in a battery is critically dependent on the microstructure of the electrode, as an appropriate distribution of the primary components are crucial to ensuring optimal electrical conductivity, porosity, and tortuosity, such that electrochemical and transport interaction is optimized. Processing steps ranging from the combination of dry powder, wet mixing, and drying can all critically affect multi-phase interactions that influence the microstructure formation. Electrochemical probing necessitates the construction of electrodes and coin cells with the utmost care and precision.

  abstract = {The primary current-collector materials being used in lithium-ion cells are susceptible to environmental degradation: aluminum to pitting corrosion and copper to environmentally assisted cracking. Localized corrosion occurred on bare aluminum electrodes during simulated ambient-temperature cycling in an excess of electrolyte. The highly oxidizing potential associated with the positive-electrode charge condition was the primary factor. The corrosion mechanism differed from the pitting typically observed in aqueous electrolytes because each site was filled with a mixed metal/metal-oxide product, forming surface mounds or nodules. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was shown to be an effective analytical tool for characterizing the corrosion behavior of aluminum under these conditions. Based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, little difference existed in the composition of the surface film on aluminum and copper after immersion or cycling in electrolytes made with two different solvent formulations. Although Li and P were the predominant adsorbed surface species, the corrosion resistance of aluminum may simply be due to its native oxide. Finally, copper was shown to be susceptible to environmental cracking at or near the lithium potential when specific metallurgical conditions existed (work hardening and large grain size). \textcopyright{} 1999 The Electrochemical Society.

Current collectors must be electrochemically stable when in contact with the cell component during the potential operation window of an electrode. Various electrochemical techniques have been used to investigate the corrosion of current collector materials. In practice, continued corrosion of current collectors leads to a gradual increase in the internal resistance of cells, which causes the capacity to fade gradually. Corrosion of the current collector may induce a short-circuit, affecting its safety. Thus, the formation of thick and compact, protective passive film on the metal surface is highly important so as to ensure battery performance and safety. Depending on the salts and additives, different types of protective films are formed. The solubility of these surface layers in the electrolyte is a determining factor in the overall stability of the current collector. In this review, we introduce the electrochemical behavior and protective film formation processes of various metallic current collectors in representative electrolytes.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional carbon nitride is considered a very good battery electrode material owing to its uniform-size pores and the presence of nitrogen atoms. First-principles calculations were used to investigate the adsorption and storage of lithium and sodium on monolayer g-C2N. The capacities of lithium and sodium ion batteries for monolayer g-C2N are 596 (LiC2N) and 276 (NaC4N2) mAh/g, respectively. The average Li binding energy reaches 2.39 eV relative to isolated Li atoms, which suggests that the lithium capacity achieved on g-C2N might not be sustained during cycling. By varying the ratio of C to N atoms, it is found that the average Li binding energy is reduced to only 1.69 eV for C:N \textasciitilde{} 5:1, indicating a significant improvement in cycling performance while maintaining the reversible capacity. The mobility barrier energies to Li ion diffusion between two layers in bulk structures with AA and AB stacking sequences are 0.25 and 1.23 eV, respectively, indicating that high Li ion conductivity could be achieved in bulk g-C2N with AA stacking. These calculations demonstrate that graphitic carbon nitride with uniform-size pores can be used as an electrode material with high capacity and high lithium mobility.},

However, it remains unexplored to further enlarge the interlayer spacing and reveal the influence of heteroatom doping on carbon nanostructures for developing more efficient SIB anode materials. Here, a series of N-rich few-layer graphene (N-FLG) with tuneable interlayer distance ranging from 0.45 to 0.51 nm is successfully synthesized by annealing graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) under zinc catalysis and selected temperature (T = 700, 800, and 900 \textdegree{}C). More significantly, the correlation between N dopants and interlayer distance of resultant N-FLG-T highlights the effect of pyrrolic N on the enlargement of graphene interlayer spacing, due to its stronger electrostatic repulsion. As a consequence, N-FLG-800 achieves the optimal properties in terms of interlayer spacing, nitrogen configuration and electronic conductivity. When used as an anode for SIBs, N-FLG-800 shows remarkable Na+ storage performance with ultrahigh rate capability (56.6 mAh g-1 at 40 A g-1) and excellent long-term stability (211.3 mAh g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 after 2000 cycles), demonstrating the effectiveness of material design.},

Molybdenum disulfide is a highly promising material for LIBs that compensates for its intermediate insertion voltage ({$\sim$}2 V vs. Li/Li+) with a high reversible capacity (up to 1290 mA h g-1) and an excellent rate capability (e.g. 554 mA h g-1 after 20 cycles at 50 C). Several themes emerge when surveying the scientific literature on the subject: first, we argue that there is excellent data to show that truly nanoscale structures, which often contain a nanodispersed carbon phase, consistently possess superior charge storage capacity and cycling performance. We provide several hypotheses regarding why the measured capacities in such architectures are well above the theoretical predictions of the known MoS2 intercalation and conversion reactions. Second, we highlight the growing microstructural and electrochemical evidence that the layered MoS2 structure does not survive past the initial lithiation cycle, and that subsequently the electrochemically active material is actually elemental sulfur. Third, we show that certain synthesis techniques are consistently demonstrated to be the most promising for battery applications, and describe these in detail. Fourth, we present our selection of synthesis methods that we believe to have a high potential for creating improved MoS2 LIB electrodes, but are yet to be tried.},

This paper reviews the main achievements on performance and understanding of charge\textendash{}discharge mechanisms, resulting from the tremendous activity devoted to these systems in the past few years. As a matter of fact, all carbon materials can be lithiated to a certain extent. However, the amount of lithium reversibly incorporated in the carbon lattice (the reversible capacity), the faradaic losses during the first charge\textendash{}discharge cycle (the irreversible capacity), the profile of the voltage curves during charging and discharging, all depend on the structure, the texture and heteroatom content of the carbon material.

By reviewing results obtained with different electrolyte solutions (e.g. ethylene carbonate-based solutions, propylene carbonate solutions, and ether-based systems), we describe the stabilization and capacity fading mechanisms of graphite electrodes. One of the failure mechanisms occurs at potentials {$>$}0.5 V Li/Li+, and relates to an increase in the electrode's impedance due to improper passivation and a simultaneous change in the electrode's morphology, probably due to gas formation. At low potentials (depending on the electrolyte solution involved), phenomena such as exfoliation and amorphization of the graphite electrodes can be observed. Stabilization mechanisms are also discussed. In general, surface stabilization of the graphite is essential for obtaining reversible lithiation and a long electrode cycle life. The latter usually relates to precipitation of highly compact and insoluble surface species, which adhere well, and irreversibly, to the active surface. Hence, the choice of appropriate electrolyte solutions in terms of solvents, salts and additives is very critical for the use of graphite anodes in Li batteries. The major analytical tools for this study included FTIR and impedance spectroscopies, XPS, and in situ and ex situ XRD in conjunction with standard electrochemical techniques.},

It was found that even in cases where the surface films formed on lithium contain elastomers, or where the lithium metal reactivity is reduced by doping with elements such as N, As, Al, Mg, Ca, etc., it is impossible to achieve sufficient passivation with lithium electrodes and liquid solutions. Passivation is considerably worsened when Li electrodes are operated at high rates (especially at high charging, Li deposition rates). Thus, there is no way that rechargeable Li batteries can compete with Li-ion batteries in any application that requires high charging rates (e.g., in powering portable electronic devices). The electrochemical behavior of lithiated graphite electrodes also depends on passivation phenomena. The surface films formed on lithiated graphite are similar to those formed on Li metal in the same solutions. The volume changes of graphite electrodes during Li insertion\textendash{}deinsertion are small enough to enable their reasonable passivation in a variety of electrolyte solutions. A critical factor that determines the stability of graphite electrodes is their morphology.

The scaled-up and reliable production of graphene derivatives, such as graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO), offers a wide range of possibilities to synthesize graphene-based functional materials for various applications. This critical review presents and discusses the current development of graphene-based composites. After introduction of the synthesis methods for graphene and its derivatives as well as their properties, we focus on the description of various methods to synthesize graphene-based composites, especially those with functional polymers and inorganic nanostructures. Particular emphasis is placed on strategies for the optimization of composite properties.

  abstract = {Supercapacitors (also known as `ultracapacitors') offer a promising alternative approach to meeting the increasing power demands of energy-storage systems in general, and of portable (digital) electronic devices in particular. Supercapacitors are able to store and deliver energy at relatively high rates (beyond those accessible with batteries) because the mechanism of energy storage is simple charge-separation (as in conventional capacitors). The vast increases in capacitance achieved by supercapacitors are due to the combination of: (i) an extremely small distance that separates the opposite charges, as defined by the electric double-layer; (ii) highly porous electrodes that embody very high surface-area. A variety of porous forms of carbon are currently preferred as the electrode materials because they have exceptionally high surface areas, relatively high electronic conductivity, and acceptable cost. The power and energy-storage capabilities of these devices are closely linked to the physical and chemical characteristics of the carbon electrodes. For example, increases in specific surface-area, obtained through activation of the carbon, generally lead to increased capacitance. Since only the electrolyte-wetted surface-area contributes to capacitance, the carbon processing is required to generate predominantly `open' pores that are connected to the bulk pore network. While the supercapacitors available today perform well, it is generally agreed that there is considerable scope for improvement (e.g., improved performance at higher frequencies). Thus it is likely that carbon will continue to play a principal role in supercapacitor technology, mainly through further optimization of porosity, surface treatments to promote wettability, and reduced inter-particle contact resistance.},

They can complement or replace batteries in electrical energy storage and harvesting applications, when high power delivery or uptake is needed. A notable improvement in performance has been achieved through recent advances in understanding charge storage mechanisms and the development of advanced nanostructured materials. The discovery that ion desolvation occurs in pores smaller than the solvated ions has led to higher capacitance for electrochemical double layer capacitors using carbon electrodes with subnanometre pores, and opened the door to designing high-energy density devices using a variety of electrolytes. Combination of pseudo-capacitive nanomaterials, including oxides, nitrides and polymers, with the latest generation of nanostructured lithium electrodes has brought the energy density of electrochemical capacitors closer to that of batteries. The use of carbon nanotubes has further advanced micro-electrochemical capacitors, enabling flexible and adaptable devices to be made. Mathematical modelling and simulation will be the key to success in designing tomorrow's high-energy and high-power devices.},

Therefore, much effort has been made to synthesize and tailor the microstructures of porous carbon materials via various activation procedures (physical and chemical activation). In particular, the chemical activation of various carbon sources using KOH as the activating reagent is very promising because of its lower activation temperature and higher yields, and well-defined micropore size distribution and ultrahigh specific surface area up to 3000 m2 g-1 of the resulting porous carbons. In this feature article, we will cover recent research progress since 2007 on the synthesis of KOH-activated carbons for hydrogen and electrical energy storage (supercapacitors and lithium\textendash{}sulfur batteries). The textural properties and surface chemistry of KOH-activated carbons depend on not only the synthesis parameters, but also different carbon sources employed including fossil/biomass-derived materials, synthetic organic polymers, and various nanostructured carbons (e.g. carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, carbon aerogels, carbide-derived carbons, graphene, etc.). Following the introduction to KOH activation mechanisms and processing technologies, the characteristics and performance of KOH-activated carbons as well as their relationships are summarized and discussed through the extensive analysis of the literature based on different energy storage systems.},

  abstract = {The research on electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLC), also known as supercapacitors or ultracapacitors, is quickly expanding because their power delivery performance fills the gap between dielectric capacitors and traditional batteries. However, many fundamental questions, such as the relations between the pore size of carbon electrodes, ion size of the electrolyte, and the capacitance have not yet been fully answered. We show that the pore size leading to the maximum double-layer capacitance of a TiC-derived carbon electrode in a solvent-free ethyl-methylimmidazolium-bis(trifluoro-methane-sulfonyl)imide (EMI-TFSI) ionic liquid is roughly equal to the ion size ({$\sim$}0.7 nm). The capacitance values of TiC-CDC produced at 500 \textdegree{}C are more than 160 F/g and 85 F/cm3 at 60 \textdegree{}C, while standard activated carbons with larger pores and a broader pore size distribution present capacitance values lower than 100 F/g and 50 F/cm3 in ionic liquids. A significant drop in capacitance has been observed in pores that were larger or smaller than the ion size by just an angstrom, suggesting that the pore size must be tuned with sub-angstrom accuracy when selecting a carbon/ion couple. This work suggests a general approach to EDLC design leading to the maximum energy density, which has been now proved for both solvated organic salts and solvent-free liquid electrolytes.},

Various types of G6-TMD nanomaterials, such as nanosheets, nanotubes and quantum dot nano-objects and flower-like nanostructures, have been synthesized. High thermodynamic stability under ambient conditions, even in atomically thin form, made nanosheets of these inorganic semiconductors a valuable asset in the existing library of two-dimensional (2D) materials, along with the well-known semimetallic graphene and insulating hexagonal boron nitride. G6-TMDs generally possess an appropriate bandgap (1\textendash{}2 eV) which is tunable by size and dimensionality and changes from indirect to direct in monolayer nanosheets, intriguing for (opto)electronic, sensing, and solar energy harvesting applications. Moreover, rich intercalation chemistry and abundance of catalytically active edge sites make them promising for fabrication of novel energy storage devices and advanced catalysts. In this review, we provide an overview on all aspects of the basic science, physicochemical properties and characterization techniques as well as all existing production methods and applications of G6-TMD nanomaterials in a comprehensive yet concise treatment. Particular emphasis is placed on establishing a linkage between the features of production methods and the specific needs of rapidly growing applications of G6-TMDs to develop a production-application selection guide. Based on this selection guide, a framework is suggested for future research on how to bridge existing knowledge gaps and improve current production methods towards technological application of G6-TMD nanomaterials.},

The layered structure of MoSe2 plus the size and electrical conductivity of Se provide a good opportunity for hosting counterions in electrochemical energy storage systems such as lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries. The unsaturated Se atoms at the edge and those at defective points or altered basal plane have superior electrocatalytic activity toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and similar electrocatalytic reactions (e.g., in lithium\textendash{}oxygen batteries). Furthermore, the tunable band gap of MoSe2 has made it a promising candidate for photocatalysis and photoelectrochemical solar cells.

  abstract = {Most of the reported MoSe2 electrode materials are suffered from tended stacking, large volume expansion and relatively low capacity. As shown the experiences of Li/Na-Se batteries, the encapsulating of the exfoliated MoSe2 into carbon nanospheres are successfully constructed with the introduction of C-O-Mo bonds and larger layer distance (0.89 nm). Interestingly, the C-O-Mo bonds stayed on the surface of the Se-O insulation layer can improve the rate of ions transfer and also promote the reversible conversion of MoSe2. The first-principles calculations demonstrated that the frontier molecular orbitals of C-O-Mo interface structure are mainly localized on the MoSe2 sheet fragment with an appropriate HOMO-LUMO gap ({$<$}4 eV), proving that its conductivity is being greatly enhanced with higher stability. Utilized as an anode for LIBs, it delivers Li-storage capacities of 1208 mAh g-1 after 150 cycles at 1.0 A g-1 and 519 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles at 4.0 A g-1. Also note that the Na-storage capacities are found to be 543, 491 mAh g-1 after 120 cycles at 0.1, 1.0 A g-1, respectively. Through the analysis of CV, the reduced particles might improve the capacitive behaviors, further leading to the higher rate performances. Ex-situ techniques showed that the emerging Se during the electrochemical process was constrained uniformly in the carbon matrix. More greatly, the controlling of by-product Se plays key roles in achieving high-rate capability and cycling stability, which would open up a potential avenue for these metal-selenide anodes designs of battery storage systems.},

  abstract = {This paper examines several metals that are commonly employed as current collectors of positive and negative electrodes for rechargeable lithium batteries. Current collectors must be electrochemically stable when in contact with the cell component during the potential operation window of an electrode. Various electrochemical techniques have been used to investigate the corrosion of current collector materials. In practice, continued corrosion of current collectors leads to a gradual increase in the internal resistance of cells, which causes the capacity to fade gradually. Corrosion of the current collector may induce a short-circuit, affecting its safety. Thus, the formation of thick and compact, protective passive film on the metal surface is highly important so as to ensure battery performance and safety. Depending on the salts and additives, different types of protective films are formed. The solubility of these surface layers in the electrolyte is a determining factor in the overall stability of the current collector. In this review, we introduce the electrochemical behavior and protective film formation processes of various metallic current collectors in representative electrolytes.},

The results show that the liquid gallium negative electrode enables the reversible alloying/dealloying between Al and Ga. Remarkably, the essential problems in the solid Al negative electrodes, including dendrite, corrosion and pulverization, would be well avoided attributed to the liquid state of the Ga electrode during cycling. In addition to the enhanced stable cycling performance, Ga negative electrode is also recyclable, allowing the cycled Ga for further presenting stable cycling in the re-assembled batteries, and which is helpful for its practical application. The results in the present work open a precedent way to develop the advanced negative electrode with dendrite-free, corrosion resistant and recyclable features and advantages for various types of rechargeable batteries.},

  abstract = {To meet the growing global demand for energy while preserving the environment, it is necessary to drastically reduce the world's dependence on non-renewable energy sources. At the core of this effort will be the ability to efficiently convert, store, transport and access energy in a variety of ways. Batteries for use in small consumer devices have saturated society; however, if they are ever to be useful in large-scale applications such as automotive transportation or grid-storage, they will require new materials with dramatically improved performance. Efforts must also focus on using Earth-abundant and nontoxic compounds so that whatever developments are made will not create new environmental problems.In this Account, we describe a general strategy for the design and development of new insertion electrode materials for Li(Na)-ion batteries that meet these requirements. We begin by reviewing the current state of the art of insertion electrodes and highlighting the intrinsic material properties of electrodes that must be re-engineered for extension to larger-scale applications. We then present a detailed discussion of the relevant criteria for the conceptual design and appropriate selection of new electrode chemical compositions.We describe how the open-circuit voltage of Li-ion batteries can be manipulated and optimized through structural and compositional tuning by exploiting differences in the electronegativity among possible electrode materials. We then discuss which modern synthetic techniques are most sustainable, allowing the creation of new materials via environmentally responsible reactions that minimize the use of energy and toxic solvents. Finally, we present a case study showing how we successfully employed these approaches to develop a large number of new, useful electrode materials within the recently discovered family of transition metal fluorosulfates. This family has attracted interest as a possible source of improved Li-ion batteries in larger scale applications and benefits from a relatively ``green'' synthesis.},

The main difficulty in high-rate charge-discharge experiments is kinetic problems due to the slow diffusion of Li-ions in electrodes.

However, while various nanoelectrodes that provide excellent high-rate capability have been synthesized, a size-controlled synthesis and a systematic study of nanocrystalline LiCoO2 have not been carried out because of the difficulty in controlling the size. We have established the size-controlled synthesis of nanocrystalline LiCoO2 through a hydrothermal reaction and, for the first time, clarified the structural and electrochemical properties of this intercalation cathode material. Lattice expansion in nanocrystalline LiCoO2 was found from powder X-ray diffraction measurements and Raman spectroscopy. Electrochemical measurements and theoretical analyses on nanocrystalline LiCoO2 revealed that extreme size reduction below 15 nm was not favorable for most applications. An excellent high-rate capability (65\% of the 1 C rate capability at 100 C) was observed in nanocrystalline LiCoO2 with an appropriate particle size of 17 nm.},

These devices, although early in their stage of development, are promising for large-scale grid storage applications due to the abundance and very low cost of sodium-containing precursors used to make the components. The engineering knowledge developed recently for highly successful Li ion batteries can be leveraged to ensure rapid progress in this area, although different electrode materials and electrolytes will be required for dual intercalation systems based on sodium. In particular, new anode materials need to be identified, since the graphite anode, commonly used in lithium systems, does not intercalate sodium to any appreciable extent. A wider array of choices is available for cathodes, including high performance layered transition metal oxides and polyanionic compounds. Recent developments in electrodes are encouraging, but a great deal of research is necessary, particularly in new electrolytes, and the understanding of the SEI films. The engineering modeling calculations of Na-ion battery energy density indicate that 210 Wh kg-1 in gravimetric energy is possible for Na-ion batteries compared to existing Li-ion technology if a cathode capacity of 200 mAh g-1 and a 500 mAh g-1 anode can be discovered with an average cell potential of 3.3 V.},

Moreover, in contrast to lead and cadmium, magnesium is inexpensive, environmentally friendly and safe to handle. But the development of Mg batteries has been hindered by two problems. First, owing to the chemical activity of Mg, only solutions that neither donate nor accept protons are suitable as electrolytes; but most of these solutions allow the growth of passivating surface films, which inhibit any electrochemical reaction1,2,3. Second, the choice of cathode materials has been limited by the difficulty of intercalating Mg ions in many hosts4. Following previous studies of the electrochemistry of Mg electrodes in various non-aqueous solutions1,5, and of a variety of intercalation electrodes6,7, we have now developed rechargeable Mg battery systems that show promise for applications. The systems comprise electrolyte solutions based on Mg organohaloaluminate salts, and MgxMo3S4 cathodes, into which Mg ions can be intercalated reversibly, and with relatively fast kinetics. We expect that further improvements in the energy density will make these batteries a viable alternative to existing systems.},

  abstract = {When identical dry Li-ion batteries are filled with different electrolyte solutions, those with higher coulombic efficiency (CE) normally have a longer life-time, provided the batteries have the same test history (storage time and temperature, cycling protocol etc.). Accurate CE measurements can therefore be used to rapidly rank cells according to their life-time without relying on tests that are many years long. The CE of Li-ion cells normally increases with time since SEI layers thicken and parasitic reactions between electrodes and electrolyte, which cause the departure of the CE from unity, slow down. However, in some cases, the CE of Li-ion cells has been observed to be greater than unity and decrease during early charge-discharge cycling, which is unexpected. This anomalous behavior is shown here to be caused by the impact of lithium atoms stored in the negative electrode ``overhang'', the small portion of the negative electrode that extends past the positive electrode in commercial Li-ion cells. Storage protocols are discussed that allow CE to more rapidly stabilize with time or cycle number.},

  abstract = {An experimental work on the influence of temperature and the activating agent on the development of surface area and porosity for activated carbons was carried out. Three coals from different regions of Colombia were activated with CO2, steam and a CO2\textendash{}steam mixture. Coal from the Antioquia Region (La Capotera) was activated with a CO2\textendash{}steam mixture at 1073, 1123 and 1173 K and with CO2 and steam at 1073 K. Other two coals from Antioquia and Cesar regions (La Grande and Borrego) regions were activated with a CO2\textendash{}steam mixture at 1073 K and these were compared with the La Capotera char for the same conditions. The content of ash was confirmed to affect the development of surface area: coals with lower amount of ash developed higher specific surface areas. Activation temperature also affected the development of surface area: the use of high temperature produced low surface areas. Results indicate that CO2\textendash{}steam produces larger surface areas than CO2 and steam alone, and reactions with CO2\textendash{}steam and CO2 develop a more uniform porosity than reaction with steam. The pore sizes are larger when steam is used and smaller when CO2 is used.},

The morphology of human hair samples before and after pyrolysis was characterized using scanning electron microscopy. The chemical composition of natural and pyrolyzed human hairs was also characterized using Raman spectroscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Screen printed carbon electrodes were modified with the hair-derived carbons and applied for electrochemical sensing of dopamine and ascorbic acid. The hair-derived carbons significantly improved the performance of the electrochemical sensors compared to the unmodified sensors. This method provides an easy, simple, and inexpensive way to fabricate hollow 3D glassy carbon microelectrodes.},

This result was followed by the fabrication of symmetric supercapacitor and delivered an energy density of 19.2Whkg-1. The energy density has been further improved by introducing an insertion type electrode, Li4Ti5O12 in Li-ion hybrid electrochemical capacitor (Li-HEC) assembly.

  abstract = {The electrochemical performance of alternative anode materials for Li-ion batteries is often measured using composite electrodes consisting of active material and conductive carbon additives. Cycling of these composite electrodes at low voltages demonstrates charge storage at the operating potentials of viable anodes, however, the conductive carbon additive is also able to store charge in the low potential regime. The contribution of the conductive carbon additives to the observed capacity is often neglected when interpreting the electrochemical performance of electrodes. To provide a reference for the contribution of the carbons to the observed capacity, we report the charge storage behavior of two common conductive carbon additives Super P and Ketjenblack as a function of voltage, rate, and electrolyte composition. Both carbons exhibit substantial capacities after 100 cycles, up to 150 mAh g-1, when cycled to 10 mV. The capacity is dependent on the discharge cutoff voltage and cycling rate with some dependence on electrolyte composition. The first few cycles are dominated by the formation of the SEI followed by a fade to a steady, reversible capacity thereafter. Neglecting the capacity of the carbon additive can lead to significant errors in the estimation of charge storage capabilities of the active material.},

XPS analysis shows that the mixed acid oxidation produces carbonyl (C=O) and the carboxyl (O-C=O) groups, the air oxidation results in hydroxyl and the smallest amount of carbonyl and carboxyl groups, and both the nitric acid and potassium permanganate treatments result in a moderate amount of carbonyl and carboxyl groups. It was found that the specific surface area and pore structures of the four samples are similar and carbonyl and carboxyl groups contribute the most to pseudo-capacitance through a Faradic reaction. In particular, the carbonyl group has a proportional relationship to the capacitance of CNTs. However, the hydroxyl group does not lead to an obvious increase of pseudo-capacitance, but can increase the electric double layer capacitance. The carbonyl and the carboxyl groups are advantageous for fast Faradic reactions to introduce pseudo-capacitance, owing to their lower charge transfer resistance than that of the hydroxyl group.},

  abstract = {For incompletely reduced graphene oxides (RGOs), an effect of oxygen functional groups such as carboxyl, phenol, carbonyl, and quinone on electrochemical capacitive behavior was studied. To prepare RGO thin-film electrodes, a simple fabrication process by (i) dropping and evaporating the graphene oxide (GO) solution, (ii) irradiating pulsed light, and (iii) heat-treating at 200 {$\sim$} 360\textdegree{}C was applied. It was notable that the pulsed light irradiation was effective to prevent the disfiguring of deposited GO thin-film during the thermal reduction. From XRD analyses, interlayer distances of the RGOs were gradually decreased from 0.379 to 0.354nm. As increasing the thermal reduction temperature from 200 to 360\textdegree{}C, XPS O 1s spectra analyses showed that the atomic percentages of carboxyl and phenol of the RGOs were sustained as 5.40{$\pm$}0.36 and 4.77{$\pm$}0.41 at\% respectively. Meanwhile, those of carbonyl and quinone of the RGOs were gradually declined from 3.10 to 1.81 and from 1.32 to 0.65 at\% with different thermal reduction temperature respectively. For all RGO thin-film electrodes, the specific capacitance from the CV measurement in 6M KOH was sustained as ca. 220 F g-1 at the scan of 5mV s-1. However, in 1M H2SO4, the specific capacitance was gradually decreased from 171 to 136 F g-1. After 100,000 cycles in 6M KOH, 1M H2SO4, and 0.5M Na2SO4, the RGO (200\textdegree{}C) electrodes showed ca. 92, 54, and 104\% of the initial capacitances respectively. The atomic percentages of the oxygen functional groups involved in the pseudocapacitive Faradaic reaction were decreased after the cycle test. Especially in 1M H2SO4, quinone group was decreased to ca. 48\% of initial atomic percentage, which seems to be a main reason for the drastic reduction of capacitance. The specific pseudocapacitance per unit atomic percentage for either carboxyl or phenol group in 6M KOH was obtained as 12.59 F g-1 at\%-1. For carbonyl group in 1M H2SO4, it was a slightly deviated value as 13.55 F g-1 at\%-1. For quinone group in 1M H2SO4, it was 27.09 F g-1at\%-1.},

  abstract = {This article aims to offer a critical overview of selected literature on capacitive and non-capacitive faradaic charge storage. It is particularly relevant to the concept of pseudocapacitance that is generally described as a result of fast surface faradaic processes. In general, faradaic processes represent electron transfer reactions at the interface between an electrode and its contacting solid or liquid electrolyte phase that is able to accept or donate electrons. Obviously, not all faradaic processes can be associated with pseudocapacitance. The question is how to differentiate pseudocapacitance related faradaic charge storage from the others. Therefore, attempts have been made to apply the band model for semiconductors to account qualitatively for the origin of pseudocapacitance. Capacitive and non-capacitive faradaic processes are then proposed to define and differentiate different charge storage mechanisms in supercapacitor and battery. On the other hand, the unequal electrode capacitance approach and the use of Ca2+ in aqueous electrolytes are discussed in relation with enhanced energy capacity of supercapacitors. In addition, the principle of supercapattery as a hybrid device is explained with recent literature examples.},

Owing to their inherently low electronic conductivity, it is essential to optimize their properties to minimize defect concentration and crystallite size (down to the submicron level), control morphology, and to decorate the crystallite surfaces with conductive nanostructures that act as conduits to deliver electrons to the bulk lattice. Here, we discuss factors relating to doping and defects in olivine phosphates LiMPO4 (M = Fe, Mn, Co, Ni) and describe methods by which in situ nanophase composites with conductivities ranging from 10(-4)-10(-2) S cm(-1) can be prepared. These utilize surface reactivity to produce intergranular nitrides, phosphides, and/or phosphocarbides at temperatures as low as 600 degrees C that maximize the accessibility of the bulk for Li de/insertion. Surface modification can only address the transport problem in part, however. A key issue in these materials is also to unravel the factors governing ion and electron transport within the lattice. Lithium de/insertion in the phosphates is accompanied by two-phase transitions owing to poor solubility of the single phase compositions, where low mobility of the phase boundary limits the rate characteristics. Here we discuss concerted mobility of the charge carriers. Using M{\"o}ssbauer spectroscopy to pinpoint the temperature at which the solid solution forms, we directly probe small polaron hopping in the solid solution Li(x)FePO4 phases formed at elevated temperature, and give evidence for a strong correlation between electron and lithium delocalization events that suggests they are coupled.},

  abstract = {Temperature is known to have a significant impact on the performance, safety and cycle lifetime of lithium-ion batteries (LiB). However, the comprehensive effects of temperature on the cyclic aging rate of LiB have yet to be found. We use an electrochemistry-based model (ECBE) here to measure the effects on the aging behavior of cycled LiB operating within the temperature range of 25\,\textdegree{}C to 55\,\textdegree{}C. The increasing degradation rate of the maximum charge storage of LiB during cycling at elevated temperature is found to relate mainly to the degradations at the electrodes and that the degradation of LCO cathode is larger than graphite anode at elevated temperature. In particular, the formation and modification of the surface films on the electrodes as well as structural/phase changes of the LCO electrode, as reported in the literatures, are found to be the main contributors to the increasing degradation rate of the maximum charge storage of LiB with temperature for the specific operating temperature range. Larger increases in the Warburg elements and cell impedance are also found with cycling at higher temperature, but they do not seriously affect the state of health (SoH) of LiB as shown in this work.},

As rechargeable batteries, lithium-ion batteries serve as power sources in various application systems. Temperature, as a critical factor, significantly impacts on the performance of lithium-ion batteries and also limits the application of lithium-ion batteries. Moreover, different temperature conditions result in different adverse effects. Accurate measurement of temperature inside lithium-ion batteries and understanding the temperature effects are important for the proper battery management. In this review, we discuss the effects of temperature to lithium-ion batteries at both low and high temperature ranges. The current approaches in monitoring the internal temperature of lithium-ion batteries via both contact and contactless processes are also discussed in the review.},

Biology and biomimetic processes in ionic liquids are also discussed. In these decidedly different materials, some enzymes show activity that is not exhibited in more traditional systems, creating huge potential for bioinspired catalysis and biofuel cells. Our goal in this review is to survey the recent key developments and issues within ionic-liquid research in these areas.

  abstract = {Ionically conducting polymer membranes (polymer electrolytes) might enhance lithium-battery technology by replacing the liquid electrolyte currently in use and thereby enabling the fabrication of flexible, compact, laminated solid-state structures free from leaks and available in varied geometries1. Polymer electrolytes explored for these purposes are commonly complexes of a lithium salt (LiX) with a high-molecular-weight polymer such as polyethylene oxide (PEO). But PEO tends to crystallize below 60\,\textdegree{}C, whereas fast ion transport is a characteristic of the amorphous phase. So the conductivity of PEO\textendash{}LiX electrolytes reaches practically useful values (of about 10-4\,S\,cm-1) only at temperatures of 60\textendash{}80\,\textdegree{}C. The most common approach for lowering the operational temperature has been to add liquid plasticizers, but this promotes deterioration of the electrolyte's mechanical properties and increases its reactivity towards the lithium metal anode. Here we show that nanometre-sized ceramic powders can perform as solid plasticizers for PEO, kinetically inhibiting crystallization on annealing from the amorphous state above 60\,\textdegree{}C. We demonstrate conductivities of around 10-4\,S\,cm-1 at 50\,\textdegree{}C and 10-5\,S\,cm-1 at 30\,\textdegree{}C in a PEO\textendash{}LiClO4 mixture containing powders of TiO2 and Al2O3 with particle sizes of 5.8\textendash{}13\,nm. Further optimization might lead to practical solid-state polymer electrolytes for lithium batteries.},

The initial discharge capacity was about 370 mA h (g-CuCl2)-1 at 0.028C-rate (11 mA (g-CuCl2)-1), which was almost the same as the theoretical value (399 mA h (g-CuCl2)-1) and higher than that of insertion-type positive electrode materials as used in the rechargeable Al battery. Moreover, a two-stage discharge plateau voltage was observed at 1.5 V and 0.8 V, which was higher than other conversion type positive electrodes for the aluminum rechargeable battery. The high discharge voltage realized a high energy density of 426 mW h (g-CuCl2)-1, which is the highest energy density compared with other conversion type positive electrodes. Two different strategies were implemented to increase the lifetime of the cell, namely, increasing the upper cut-off voltage and decreasing the particle size of CuCl2. The discharge capacity for the electrode at the second cycle was threefold that for a pristine CuCl2 electrode.},

Furthermore, the ECB can work at bending angles of 0-80\textdegree{} with a capacity retention of 92.3\% after 40 bending cycles. The flexibility of the ECB is ascribed to the flexible, porous, and highly stable features of the AGM as well as the deformability of the PET/ITO substrate. The potential widow of the ECB can be largely enhanced by connecting small-sized ECBs internally in series while maintaining the energy density unchanged. The present study demonstrates that the ECB using the AGM as the electrolyte carrier and separator may have great potentials for the construction of both flexible, portable electronics and smart windows.},

  volume = {51},
  issn = {0013-4686},
  abstract = {Salts having a low melting point are liquid at room temperature, or even below, and form a new class of liquids usually called room temperature ionic liquids (RTIL). Information about RTILs can be found in the literature with such key words as: room temperature molten salt, low-temperature molten salt, ambient-temperature molten salt, liquid organic salt or simply ionic liquid. Their physicochemical properties are the same as high temperature ionic liquids, but the practical aspects of their maintenance or handling are different enough to merit a distinction. The class of ionic liquids, based on tetraalkylammonium cation and chloroaluminate anion, has been extensively studied since late 1970s of the XX century, following the works of Osteryoung. Systematic research on the application of chloroaluminate ionic liquids as solvents was performed in 1980s. However, ionic liquids based on aluminium halides are moisture sensitive. During the last decade an increasing number of new ionic liquids have been prepared and used as solvents. The general aim of this paper was to review the physical and chemical properties of RTILs from the point of view of their possible application as electrolytes in electrochemical processes and devices. The following points are discussed: melting and freezing, conductivity, viscosity, temperature dependence of conductivity, transport and transference numbers, electrochemical stability, possible application in aluminium electroplating, lithium batteries and in electrochemical capacitors.},

  abstract = {The challenges for further development of Li rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles are reviewed. Most important is safety, which requires development of a nonflammable electrolyte with either a larger window between its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) or a constituent (or additive) that can develop rapidly a solid/electrolyte-interface (SEI) layer to prevent plating of Li on a carbon anode during a fast charge of the battery. A high Li+-ion conductivity ({$\sigma$}Li {$>$} 10-4 S/cm) in the electrolyte and across the electrode/electrolyte interface is needed for a power battery. Important also is an increase in the density of the stored energy, which is the product of the voltage and capacity of reversible Li insertion/extraction into/from the electrodes. It will be difficult to design a better anode than carbon, but carbon requires formation of an SEI layer, which involves an irreversible capacity loss. The design of a cathode composed of environmentally benign, low-cost materials that has its electrochemical potential {$\mu$}C well-matched to the HOMO of the electrolyte and allows access to two Li atoms per transition-metal cation would increase the energy density, but it is a daunting challenge. Two redox couples can be accessed where the cation redox couples are ``pinned'' at the top of the O 2p bands, but to take advantage of this possibility, it must be realized in a framework structure that can accept more than one Li atom per transition-metal cation. Moreover, such a situation represents an intrinsic voltage limit of the cathode, and matching this limit to the HOMO of the electrolyte requires the ability to tune the intrinsic voltage limit. Finally, the chemical compatibility in the battery must allow a long service life.},

Combination of pseudo-capacitive nanomaterials, including oxides, nitrides and polymers, with the latest generation of nanostructured lithium electrodes has brought the energy density of electrochemical capacitors closer to that of batteries.

A cross-linked comb-copolymer, consisting of ethylene oxide (EO), 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl glycidyl ether (MEEGE), and allyl glycidyl ether (AGE), was used as a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE). LiCoO2 composite cathodes were fabricated using binder comb-copolymers, consisting of EO and MEEGE with different compositions. Ionic conductivity of the SPE, and the interfacial charge transfer processes between the SPE and metallic lithium and between the SPE and the composite cathode at several cathode potentials versus Li/Li+, were electrochemically explored. With increasing MEEGE composition in the binder copolymers, the interfacial resistances between the SPE and the composite cathode appreciably decreased. As the result, discharge capacity of the LPB also enhanced with increasing the MEEGE composition. The introduction of the branched-side-chains to the polymer backbone to the binder polymers for the composite cathodes caused to facilitate the interfacial charge transport processes, while the introduction had also been found to be very effective in terms of the enhancement of ionic conductivity of SPE.},
