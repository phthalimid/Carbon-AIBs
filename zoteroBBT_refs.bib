As a result of immense progress in the field, cost-effective and high performance batteries are imperative to meeting the future demand of sustainability. Currently, the best performing batteries are lithium-ion based, but limited lithium (Li) resources make research into alternatives essential. In recent years, the performance of aluminium-ion batteries has improved remarkably in all battery-relevant metrics, which renders them a promising alternative. Compared with monovalent Li-ion batteries, aluminium (Al) cations can carry three positive charges, which could result in higher energy densities. This review describes recent developments in Al-based cathode materials. The major goal of this review is to highlight strengths and weaknesses of various different approaches and provide guidelines for future research.},

  abstract = {The thermodynamic properties of magnesium make it a natural choice for use as an anode material in rechargeable batteries, because it may provide a considerably higher energy density than the commonly used lead\textendash{}acid and nickel\textendash{}cadmium systems. Moreover, in contrast to lead and cadmium, magnesium is inexpensive, environmentally friendly and safe to handle. But the development of Mg batteries has been hindered by two problems. First, owing to the chemical activity of Mg, only solutions that neither donate nor accept protons are suitable as electrolytes; but most of these solutions allow the growth of passivating surface films, which inhibit any electrochemical reaction. Second, the choice of cathode materials has been limited by the difficulty of intercalating Mg ions in many hosts. Following previous studies of the electrochemistry of Mg electrodes in various non-aqueous solutions, and of a variety of intercalation electrodes, we have now developed rechargeable Mg battery systems that show promise for applications. The systems comprise electrolyte solutions based on Mg organohaloaluminate salts, and MgxMo 3S4 cathodes, into which Mg ions can be intercalated reversibly, and with relatively fast kinetics. We expect that further improvements in the energy density will make these batteries a viable alternative to existing systems.},

  volume = {2},
  abstract = {Using first-principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulation, we study the working mechanism in an aluminum-graphite electrochemical cell, which was recently reported to exhibit attractive performance. We exclude the possibility of Al3+ cation intercalation into graphite as in standard Li-ion batteries. Instead, we show that the AlCl4- anion intercalation mechanism is thermodynamically feasible. By including the ionic liquid electrolyte in the overall redox reaction, we are able to reproduce the high voltage observed in experiment. The active involvement of electrolyte in the reaction suggests that the evaluation of energy density needs to take the electrolyte into consideration. Our proposed structural model is consistent with the new peaks appearing in X-ray diffraction from the intercalation compound. The high rate capability is explained by the ultralow diffusion barriers of the AlCl4 intercalant. With the clarified working mechanism, it becomes clear that the high voltage of the Al-graphite cell is a result of the thermodynamic instability of the AlCl4-intercalated graphite. \textcopyright{} 2017 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract = {Multi-shell fullerenes known as onion-like carbon (OLC) are especially attractive in applications relative to energy storage, such as electrochemical capacitors, due to a near-spherical shape of particles, their nanoscale diameters and high conductivity leading to fast rate performance. Because of this, onion-like carbon can be fabricated into electrodes, used as a conductive additive, and may have potential in composites and additive manufacturing. However due to agglomeration of OLC particles, creating a stable, aqueous dispersion for ink production or formulating composites proves challenging. We explore how attrition milling, acid treatment, and probe sonication can be employed to decrease agglomeration and provide colloidal stability in aqueous media. We also investigate how the electrochemical performance changes with each processing step as well as the treatments in succession. When tested in electrochemical capacitors, the processing increases the capacitance by a factor of three, due to an added pseudocapacitive contribution which is not present in untreated OLC. As a result, the processing of OLC proves to be advantageous for the production of stable, aqueous solutions, which also exhibit improved electrochemical properties suitable for functional inks, conductive additives, and fabrication of composite electrodes.},
